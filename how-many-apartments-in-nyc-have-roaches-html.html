The city that never sleeps... unless you hear the skittering of tiny legs at 3 am and realize you're not alone. Yes, we're talking about those unwelcome roommates - the infamous NYC roach. But just how widespread is this eight-legged phenomenon? Buckle up, because we're diving deep (or should we say, shallow, because that's where roaches like to hang out) into the roach-infested underbelly of the Big Apple.</p><h3 data-sourcepos=5:1-5:47>Roach or Not to Roach, That is the Question</h3><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:313><strong>Let's face it, folks, roaches in NYC are about as common as overpriced lattes.</strong> A survey by M&M Pest Control (not sponsored by M&M's, thankfully) suggests that <strong>one in six New Yorkers share their digs with these creepy crawlies</strong>. That's a whole lot of "hello" greetings you might not be expecting.</p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:493>Now, before you pack your bags and flee to roach-free utopia (which, let's be honest, probably doesn't exist), there's a glimmer of hope. <strong>Not all apartments are created equal when it comes to roach real estate.</strong> Fancy high-rises with doormen who look like they could bench press a refrigerator? They might have better pest control (and fancier roaches, but that's a whole other story). Live-in supers who keep the building spotless? Roaches might think twice about crashing that party.</p><h3 data-sourcepos=11:1-11:49>The Roach Report: Where Be Thy Exoskeletons?</h3><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:488><strong>So, what are the roach hotspots?</strong> Brace yourselves, because this might hit a little close to home (literally, if you have a roach problem). <strong>Basements and ground floor apartments are prime territory for these unwanted guests.</strong> Why? Easy access to the great outdoors (which, for a roach, means the garbage room) and plenty of moisture to keep them happy. <strong>Even higher floors aren't completely safe</strong>, especially if you have lovely neighbors who, ahem, aren't the tidiest bunch.</p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:236><strong>The good news? There are ways to fight back!</strong> Become a master of crumb control, seal up any cracks in your walls, and invest in some good ol' fashioned roach traps (just be prepared for some late-night Olympic-level roach racing).</p><h3 data-sourcepos=17:1-17:49>The Bottom Line: Coexisting with Cockroaches</h3><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:533>Let's be real. <strong>Unless you live in a penthouse with a personal army of exterminators, there's a chance you might encounter a roach at some point.</strong> But don't despair! With a little vigilance and maybe a healthy dose of humor (because honestly, what else can you do?), you can share your NYC apartment without feeling totally overrun. <strong>Remember, roaches have been around since the dinosaurs. A little human can't scare them away that easily.</strong> But hey, at least you'll have a good story to tell at your next overpriced brunch.</p>5383988897745878665<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maWxfnby4ecyapbJlkaWus8DMnqWtq12eu2662JxkoZmmmnqzu8Ccn56rXp3Brrg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./harry-collett.html><span>←</span><span>Harry Collett Fan Casting</span></a>
