According to <a href=#>Vulture</a>, he discovered his spiritual calling in front of a century-old temple in Venice, Calif. Keegan reportedly felt "especially aligned with [the] place of worship," so he dug a hole in front of the building, and in the hole, "Keegan placed a small rose-quartz crystal, and as he dropped handfuls of dirt upon it, he made a solemn promise. 'I was clear that if there was ever an appropriate time to be in the service of the temple, I would be.'"</p><p>When the time was right, Keegan&nbsp;leased the building and launched a community called <a href=#>Full Circle</a>. The tenets of his "spiritual community center" are fairly ambiguous. The website promotes a belief that "all of us have unique gifts" and that "each of us is on a journey to fulfill a unique mission in this life." Keegan's fellowship practices yoga on the beach, hosts various music concerts to celebrate the spirit, and teaches methods of meditation and self-empowerment.</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9sBZObCJCY</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2toZn9wsM6nq2aglZa%2Fbq3Nnamer12gsqazwKdkmqaporyzsY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-rosamund-pikes-partner-children-2.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Rosamund Pike's partner and do they have children?</span></a>
