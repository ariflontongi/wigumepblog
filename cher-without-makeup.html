Candid photos of the singer are rare, but they do surface from time to time. In 2010, a bare-faced Cher was snapped on a shopping trip at a Hawaiian Scrimshaw shop at the Whaler's Village in Maui, Hawaii.</p><p>The 77-year-old was dressed casually in denim and sweats with a white straw cowboy hat perched on her black curls.

"I can look better than this," she reportedly told herself, going on to have a nose job, dental surgery, and breast enlargement. Still, Cher vows that she's had nowhere near as much work done as believed, let alone the long-rumored rib removal surgery. "I've had the same cheeks my entire life," she insisted <a href=#>in an interview</a>. "I've never even thought about having any ribs taken out."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxmbH1zgI6cn56qXay2tbTOrqtmpZGgsra8jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./vince-new-madison-avenue-store-party.html><span>←</span><span>Vince Opens Madison Avenue Store</span></a>
