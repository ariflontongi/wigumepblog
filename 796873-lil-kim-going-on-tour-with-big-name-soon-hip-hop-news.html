The biggest is <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a> who took off on her Pink Friday 2 tour earlier this year in support of the album of the same name that dropped last year in December. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Missy Elliott</a> also recently announced she was going on a star-studded tour, the first ever headlining tour of her career. Elsewhere fans have gotten to see artists like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Sexyy Red</a> and JT as they take off across the country. Another legend could be following next, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Kim</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">She hasn't officially announced a tour yet. There's no name, dates, or even a time frame of when shows will be or tickets will go on sale. In fact, from the sound of it Kim isn't even the headliner on the tour. She recently made the announcement that she was going on tour with somebody. It's unclear who she's talking about but she describes them as "special" and "amazing." In the comments of the video where she makes the announcement fans speculate on who she may be joining on tour. Almost all of that speculation is around Nicki Minaj, who will continue her world tour well into 2024. Check out the video of her making the reveal below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-lil-kim-reveals-she-s-going-on-tour-this-year>Lil Kim Reveals She's Going On Tour This Year</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Last month, Lil Kim got into some hot water with fans online. She revealed <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">she was dating a 24-year-old </a>which got fan's attention right away. Given that the rapper is nearly 50-years-old at this point it's easy to see why fans had drastic reactions to the news. The news served as an extra big surprise for fans after months of speculation <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">on who she might be dating</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Lil Kim announcing that she will guest on a very special artists tour later this year? Do you think she's talking about Nicki Minaj and would you go see her perform on the Pink Friday 2 tour?
