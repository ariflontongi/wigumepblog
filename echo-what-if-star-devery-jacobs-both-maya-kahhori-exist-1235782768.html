But there were also some viral comments that questioned if Echo was really needed after Kahhori’s breakout moment, as having two Native American characters would be “repetitive,” despite the fact that the two don’t have similar backgrounds and are among the very few diverse characters in the MCU.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><a href=# id=auto-tag_devery-jacobs data-tag=devery-jacobs>Devery Jacobs</a>, the Native American star of Reservation Dogs who appears in Echo as a character named Bonnie and voices Kahhori in What If …?, reacted to that thinking at the Los Angeles premiere of Echo on Monday while speaking with The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Would somebody go up to a white guy and say, ‘This is the one perspective for a white story that is out there’?
