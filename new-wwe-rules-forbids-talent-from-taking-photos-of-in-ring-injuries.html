Sometimes a performer ends up bloody or extra beaten after a match, but WWE doesn’t want those photos out there anymore.</p><p>The company has a lot of interesting rules, and they will sometimes adopt new ones for one reason or another. It seems that WWE wants to put an end to performers getting extra social media clout thanks to their in-ring injuries.</p><p><a href=#>Gigi Dolin accidentally busted Jacy Jayne open</a> during NXT this week. That being said, don’t expect to see any photos of Jacy Jayne’s bloody face on social media. This is new rule from WWE, according to Bryan Alvarez on<a href=#> Wrestling Observer Live</a>.</p><p>Apparently there is a new rule that WWE talent aren’t allowed to take pictuers of their injuries, and they don’t want blood whatsoever. I guess they don’t want them making merch, or whatever.</p><p><a href=#>Britt Baker and Saraya recently found themselves in controversy</a> when that t-shirt with Baker’s <a href=#>bruised face went viral. </a>WWE might want to stop anything like that from happening again.</p><p>It is also not a good look for social media when a Superstar posts a photo that some might deem as “too graphic.” If enough users report a photo for graphic content, especially blood, then it could trigger bots to suspend someone’s profile as well.</p><p>WWE might have several reasons for this new rule that make sense. Only time will tell how often these photos get out there, but it seems that Superstars aren’t allowed to make that call to share their battle wounds on their own.</p><p>What’s your take on this new WWE rule?
