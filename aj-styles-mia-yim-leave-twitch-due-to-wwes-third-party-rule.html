He will cherish those memories, but he is now suspending his account after WWE made “changes that involve streaming.”</p><p>WWE made Superstars sign over Twitch accounts to them. All revenue from those accounts will now be sent to WWE and a percentage will be divvyed out to those Superstars. That money will not be extra money for those Superstars as it will come out of their downside guarantee.</p><p><a href=#>Andrew Yang spoke out about this practice.</a> He promised that if Joe Biden wins on November 3rd then something will be done about it.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS.
