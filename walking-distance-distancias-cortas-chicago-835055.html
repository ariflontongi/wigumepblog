A quietly uplifting film about the redemption through friendship of the blighted existence of a very overweight man, the film is not unlike any number of oddball buddy movies, but what sets Mexican <strong>Alejandro Guzman Alvarez</strong>‘s feature debut apart is the figure at its center, a physically massive individual with a tiny, fragile ego.</p><p>Though it refuses to dig very deeply into some of the sensitive issues it raises, and despite a tendency towards the mawkish, there’s still enough here to suggest that Distance could proceed slowly into other Spanish-themed <span data-scayt_word=fests data-scaytid=1>fests</span> following its Chicago appearance. Indeed, the world could probably handle a few more <span data-scayt_word=non-docus data-scaytid=2>non-docus</span> about this particular issue.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p><span class="lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase lrv-u-font-family-accent lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-color-brand-primary lrv-u-font-size-16 lrv-u-display-block">The Bottom Line</span> <span class="c-span u-font-size-22@tablet u-font-style-italic lrv-u-font-family-secondary">A drama whose simplicity is sometimes just simplistic.</span></p><p>The opening image, memorably, is of the morbidly obese protagonist, <span data-scayt_word=Fede data-scaytid=3>Fede</span> (<strong>Luca Ortega</strong>), sitting with his immense, naked, glistening back to camera. As D.P.<strong> Diana <span data-scayt_word=Garay data-scaytid=4>Garay</span> <span data-scayt_word=Vinas data-scaytid=5>Vinas</span></strong>’ camera zooms slowly in, within about fifteen seconds the viewer is already feeling uncomfortably voyeuristic, but such discomfort is quickly forgotten. It’s as though <span data-scayt_word=scripter data-scaytid=6>scripter</span> <strong><span data-scayt_word=Itzel data-scaytid=7>Itzel</span> Lara </strong>has wisely decided to get the freak factor over and done with right at the start.</p><p>Friendless, innocent to the point of childishness and continually nagged by his sister <span data-scayt_word=Rosaura data-scaytid=8>Rosaura</span> (<strong>Martha Claudia Moreno</strong>), <span data-scayt_word=Fede data-scaytid=9>Fede</span> weighs somewhere north of 450 pounds and hasn’t left his frankly&nbsp;squalid house since the death of his mother ten years before. He spends his time threading beads onto string, presumably to sell them, and, encouraged by his brother-in-law Ramon (<strong>Mauricio Isaac</strong>), dreaming of taking photographs.</p><p>When he discovers an old camera film, <span data-scayt_word=Fede data-scaytid=11>Fede</span> determines to get it developed and heads off on a (for him) marathon walk to the local camera shop, where he meets Paolo (<strong>Joel Figueroa</strong>), gets his film developed and buys a cheap camera which he protects like a kid with a new toy. When it needs to be repaired, Paolo shows up at his front door to help, and the pair embarks on one of those odd-couple relationships which, when they are joined by the hen-pecked Ramon, quickly turns into an odd-trio relationship.</p><p>Walking Distance proceeds very much at walking pace, and over the first half hour, its slow rhythms sometimes seem to be emulating the heavy, uncomfortable progress of <span data-scayt_word=Fede data-scaytid=13>Fede</span> himself as he huffs and puffs. Though this is probably entirely appropriate, directly conveying some of the flavor of <span data-scayt_word=Fede’s data-scaytid=15>Fede’s</span> lifestyle, at time’s it’s unnecessarily languorous. The elephant in the room – in this case, the metaphor is more apt than usual — comes after an hour, when the subject of <span data-scayt_word=Fede’s data-scaytid=16>Fede’s</span> obesity is broached directly and its transpires that he had a heart attack years before.</p><p>Ramon is escaping from <span data-scayt_word=Rosaura data-scaytid=17>Rosaura</span> and will use his friendship with <span data-scayt_word=Fede data-scaytid=19>Fede</span> to claim a independence from her. But what’s in the relationship for Paolo is not so clear, and the script is not over-generous with him, briefly sketching out a fatherless <span data-scayt_word=backstory data-scaytid=25>backstory</span> for him before dropping his background altogether. <span data-scayt_word=Rosaura data-scaytid=18>Rosaura</span> is sensitively played by Moreno as a woman who views herself as long-suffering, but who is actually just one more bar of the cage in which <span data-scayt_word=Fede data-scaytid=20>Fede</span> has chosen to live.</p><p>Present in every scene, Ortega (actually the drummer in a well-known Mexican rock band) does great work physically, successfully conveying the hassle involved for a very big man in getting out of arm chairs, putting on a jacket, and simply advancing. He earns the viewer’s sympathy from the outset. But in other ways, it’s a performance which lacks nuance, shifting <span data-scayt_word=uncomplicatedly data-scaytid=28>uncomplicatedly</span> between the poles of melancholy and joy, with <span data-scayt_word=Fede data-scaytid=26>Fede</span> never able to verbalize very much at all about what it’s actually like to be <span data-scayt_word=Fede data-scaytid=27>Fede</span>. Given that his obesity makes him remarkable, this is a disappointing shunning of responsibility by a script which wants to push through the <span data-scayt_word=feelgood data-scaytid=31>feelgood</span> element at the expense of subtlety.</p><p>The effect of this is to make Walking Distance at times an unnecessarily sentimental film, an effect emphasized by Ortega’s own, piano-based score. The issue of how <span data-scayt_word=Fede data-scaytid=32>Fede</span> actually got this way — what dark, complex emotions brought him here — is never broached by a script which seems over-determined to keep it simple all round, but which is nonetheless often effective and unfailingly respectful of its unusual hero and his special problems.</p><p>Production companies: Centro de <span data-scayt_word=Capacitacion data-scaytid=34>Capacitacion</span> <span data-scayt_word=Cinematografica data-scaytid=35>Cinematografica</span>, <span data-scayt_word=FOPROCINE data-scaytid=36>FOPROCINE</span><br>Cast: Luca Ortega, Mauricio Isaac, Joel Figueroa, Martha Claudia Moreno<br>Director: Alejandro Guzman Alvarez<br>Screenwriter: <span data-scayt_word=Itzel data-scaytid=37>Itzel</span> Lara<br>Producers: <span data-scayt_word=Henner data-scaytid=41>Henner</span> <span data-scayt_word=Hofmann data-scaytid=42>Hofmann</span>, Karla <span data-scayt_word=Bukantz data-scaytid=43>Bukantz</span><br>Director of photography: Diana <span data-scayt_word=Garay data-scaytid=39>Garay</span> <span data-scayt_word=Vinas data-scaytid=40>Vinas</span><br>Production designer: Roxana <span data-scayt_word=Lojero data-scaytid=46>Lojero</span><br>Costume designer: <span data-scayt_word=Gisela data-scaytid=47>Gisela</span> Sanchez<br>Editor: Juan Manuel Figueroa<br>Composer: Luis ‘Luca’ Ortega<br>Casting director: <span data-scayt_word=Viridiana data-scaytid=50>Viridiana</span> <span data-scayt_word=Olvera data-scaytid=51>Olvera</span><br>Sales: Pluto Film</p><p>No rating, 104 minutes</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSrnaaesri%2FjrCYpaOZo7RusMisq5qmk5p6pbXSrZinm5mWwG6vzqurmqtdmLWqr8CgpmZwY2p9doGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1588033-uk-parliament-debate-law-phasing-smoking.html><span>←</span><span>UK parliament to debate law phasing out smoking</span></a>
