"I had a knee-jerk reaction to it because of the reputation that preceded it," Charlie told <a href=#>Bustle</a> for a feature story on Sami that was published in October 2023. Richards related it to her own experience of being labeled a "sex symbol" at a young age. "Then as soon as she joined, it was viral and she got a lot of backlash and I was concerned about that because she's so young," the "Wild Things" actor told the publication. Despite the initial negative reaction online, Sami said having an OnlyFans page was a net-positive. "I've never felt more confident in my body. I think it's because my subscribers, they're the best," she told Bustle.</p><p dir=ltr>As mentioned, Richards had Sami's back when her daughter decided to create an OnlyFans page. Sami returned the favor when her mother took the plunge. "She's been incredibly supportive of me being on there," Richards told <a href=#>People</a> in July 2022. That same month, the mother-daughter combo took their mutual support to the next level and decided to collab on OnlyFans content together in July 2022. The next year, Richards teased the idea of further shoots with Sami. "Should my mini me @samisheen and i do another collaboration soon?" Richards <a href=#>wrote</a> on her OnlyFans in October 2023.</p><p dir=ltr>That OnlyFans content led to a dramatic confrontation for Richards on "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxoaoRxfI6hprBllJq7qr%2FEZqmim5iWv6W%2FjJ2cn52embKlecOarKCgpJq%2Fbr%2FApqBmqpmovraxjJyYq52Vp3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./horizon-forbidden-west-review-ps4-ps5.html><span>←</span><span>Horizon Forbidden West review | is the new PS4 &amp;amp; PS5 game worth it?</span></a>
