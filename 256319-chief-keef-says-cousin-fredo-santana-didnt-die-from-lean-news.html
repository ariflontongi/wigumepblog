While the 27-year-old was candid about his struggles with drug addiction -- specifically Xanax and lean -- the extent of his health damages was unclear. The rapper was reportedly suffering from liver and kidney failure, and his&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">fatal seizure was caused by a cardiovascular disease</a> that is believed to have been brought on by his drug use. In turn, fans have been quick to blame codeine cough syrup for the death of Fredo Santana, but Chief Keef wants everybody to stop making that assumption.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Taking to Twitter, 24-year-old Chicago drill legend Chief Keef wished that people would stop spreading misinformation about his cousin's death.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"N***as say my cousin died of lean again and he didn't I'm fucking beating they ass," wrote Keef.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As previously stated, cardiovascular disease has been ruled as the official cause of death for Fredo Santana, not a drug addiction. Thus, saying that he passed away as a direct result of lean would be misinformed. However, it is clear that Santana's use of drugs didn't help his health condition.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Fredo Santana died at 27-years-old on January 19, 2018.
