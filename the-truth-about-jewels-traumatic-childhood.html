(According to the <a href=#>U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs</a>,&nbsp;which surveyed Vietnam veterans who were seeking treatment for PTSD, roughly 60 percent to 80 percent of those within the group also suffered from alcoholism.)</p><p>"As much as we have a genetic inheritance, we have an emotional inheritance," <a href=#>Jewel said of her upbringing</a>. "My dad was also raised in a wildly abusive home. I had a way better go of it than he did when he was young, but it still wasn't good."</p><p>At 15, Jewel decided to move to a cabin by herself to escape. "I started paying rent and working a couple jobs in town, hitchhiking to work," she told the magazine. "It felt good. My dad and I had a difficult relationship, and I thought, 'I could live in a cabin by myself or I could live in a cabin with a guy that isn't that nice to me. So, why not go live in a cabin by myself?'"</p><p>Eventually, at 18, <a href=#>Jewel spent a year homeless</a> before moving to California, where her music career would eventually take off. All throughout, Jewel said she "was determined to heal... and figure out how I could be the one who changed those habits."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma3BiZoZze9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2fsrixy6xkraqRqrqiwMicZJygmaGxqbvOnWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-fashion-insider-diary-celia-bernardo.html><span>←</span><span>The Fashion Insider Diary: Celia Bernardo</span></a>
