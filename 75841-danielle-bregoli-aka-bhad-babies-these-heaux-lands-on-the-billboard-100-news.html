The 14-year-old viral sensation has turned her 15 minutes of fame into a rap career. A few weeks a go, she released her first single "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">These Heaux</a>" and a week later, dropped the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">video for it</a>. While the song ended up charting very well on <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Spotify's global viral list</a>, turns out that the song has found itself a position on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Bhad Bhabie's "These Heaux" is now sitting at no. 77 on the charts for the week of Sept. 23rd. The song itself was teased by TMZ a few days prior to it being released and when it dropped, it really did catch the attention of many. While many people have been critical to her rap career, clearly something she's doing is working out for her. She's been taking it pretty seriously from what's been shown on social media. There has been pictures and clips surfacing of her in the studio with some pretty prominent names, so clearly she's seriously investing into her career.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Over the past few weeks, Danielle Bregoli has also dropped remixes to some popular hip hop joints. Earlier today, she dropped the remix to Tee Grizzley's "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">D to the A</a>" and prior to that, she put her own spin on <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kodak Black</a> and XXXTENTACION collab "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Roll In Peace.</a>" So, while many thought that it would be one single, it doesn't seem like she plans on stopping any time soon.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Interestingly enough, prior to even dropping a single, she was already rumored to be <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">going on tour</a>&nbsp;and the price tag was looking hefty. TMZ reported in May&nbsp;that she'd be receiving $50K per show. At the time, she didn't even have a song out and it was rumored that the tour would consist of her lip syncing and rapping to her favorite songs. While that definitely came across as a stretch, it was previously reported that she'd be getting $40K for a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">meet and greet&nbsp;</a>at this year's Rolling Loud Festival. So now that she does have a single out that's charting, maybe the idea of a tour isn't as far fetched.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
