So far it has been spotted none other than Chloë Sevigny. The actress posted about it on Instagram and then everyone started messaging Cronin to buy them. It also has plenty of Influencer fans, making it a bonafide must have this summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=ePcJnUtrAuRY data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="9 stylish pairs of hoop earrings that you definitely need in your life" class=hm-link href=#>9 stylish pairs of hoop earrings that you definitely need in your life</a></strong></p><p id=evLYLHSpCQwN data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Lily James goes back to blonde in unbelievable hair transformation" class=hm-link href=#>Lily James goes back to blonde in unbelievable hair transformation</a></strong></p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=erVmV3O4w8eO data-wc=70>"I wore a napkin as a hair bandana for ages, and my best friend came over at a dinner party and told me it looked weird… because it was a napkin—I really took that to heart,"&nbsp;Billie told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Vogue</a>.
