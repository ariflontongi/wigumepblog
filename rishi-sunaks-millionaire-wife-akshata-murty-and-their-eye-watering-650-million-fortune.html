It's also been reported that their wealth predominantly comes from their stake in Infosys, as well as Rishi's high salary from being in office.&nbsp;</p><p id=en7FmUUHnjjm data-wc=23>In 2023, their fortune was reported as £529 million, meaning the family's wealth has risen by £122 million in the last 12 months.</p><p id=e_PMCIQEzd data-wc=9><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>King Charles looks identical to surprising royal relative</a></strong></p><p id=ey1s32EVJRq data-wc=11><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Wimbledon Style: The best dressed at the 2024 tennis championships</a></strong></p><p id=e1tdxEODdBmW data-wc=56>Their staggering bank balances have come under criticism from the public, particularly in 2022 when it was reported that Akshata had non-dom status in the UK – which meant that she did not pay tax in the UK&nbsp;on income from foreign investments. At the time, her husband was in office as Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p><figure class="videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff -recommended-video"><span class=videoPlayerStyleHeader_v1l4r7u3>Recommended video</span><span class=videoPlayerStyleTitle_v1pm0z4u>You may also like</span>WATCH: King Charles meets Rishi Sunak at first in-person engagement since diagnosis</figure><p id=ejLNoqlKU19I data-wc=65>A spokesperson said at the time: "Akshata Murty is a citizen of India, the country of her birth and parent's home. India does not allow its citizens to hold the citizenship of another country simultaneously. So, according to British law, Ms Murty is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes. She has always and will continue to pay UK taxes on all her UK income."</p><p id=ea-Y0pFV44Fz data-wc=58>Akshata then dissolved the non-dom status and explained in a statement: "It has become clear that many do not feel it is compatible with my husband’s role as chancellor. I understand and appreciate the British sense of fairness and I do not wish my tax status to be a distraction for my husband or to affect my family."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eRkuMJ9vGSM2 data-wc=51>"My decision to pay UK tax on all my worldwide income will not change the fact that India remains the country of my birth, citizenship, parents’ home and place of domicile. But I love the UK too. In my time here I have invested in British businesses and supported British causes."</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
