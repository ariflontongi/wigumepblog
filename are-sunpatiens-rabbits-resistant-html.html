Although impatiens are regarded for being rabbit-resistant plants, rabbits are known to sometimes nibble the delicate petals and leaves of the flowers. This may deter a rabbit from returning to the same location. The majority of sprays are sprayed directly to the plant’s leaves and blooms, but be sure to read the label for specific application instructions.
