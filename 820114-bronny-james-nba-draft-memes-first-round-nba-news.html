Overall, this is because his father is none other than LeBron James. When you have a famous dad, these are the kinds of things that are going to happen. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">While Bronny was nowhere near a top talent,</a> he was easily the most discussed prospect in the draft. Last night, the first round of the NBA Draft was held, and as expected, Bronny was not selected.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, it is believed that Bronny will be taken by a team in the second round later today. The Los Angeles Lakers are the frontrunners to take him right now. However, teams like the Golden State Warriors and the Phoenix Suns also reportedly have interest in the star. Needless to say, his hopes have not been dashed just yet. Even if he goes undrafted, he can still sign with a team as a free agent. Sure, it's not as prestigious as being drafted, but plenty of players have had solid careers as undrafted free agents.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-bronny-james-must-wait-a-day>Bronny James Must Wait A Day</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Unfortunately, despite not even being projected to be selected on Wednesday, Bronny was still hit with a plethora of memes. Numerous Twitter users were quite cruel with these memes as they poked fun at Bronny's draft predicament. Fortunately, Bronny has a chance to prove those doubters wrong tonight. Only time will tell whether or not he gets to play with his father next year.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-the-memes-come-out>The Memes Come Out</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you thought of the NBA Draft, in the comments section down below.
