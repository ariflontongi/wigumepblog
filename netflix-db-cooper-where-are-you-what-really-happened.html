Cooper, who jumped out of an airplane with $200,000 on his person in 1971. The circumstances around his disappearance have been described as seriously intriguing and shocking. <strong>But whatever happened to him? Here's the story…</strong></p><p id=ed9woirproKT data-wc=9><strong>WATCH: Have you watched the Netflix true-crime series yet?</strong></p><h2>What happened to D.B. Cooper?</h2><p id=eSouVNyWzgKS data-wc=56>A man who called himself Dan Cooper (but was referred to by the media as DB Cooper) boarded a flight across the US. After threatening a stewardess named Florence Schaffner with a note that read he was hiding a bomb in his suitcase, he demanded $200,000 was handed to him in cash along with four parachutes.</p><p id=efmD_ZLFNE68 data-wc=48>Dan also told the pilots to divert the plane towards Mexico City and remain in the cockpit.&nbsp;Thankfully, the plane landed safely but, after sounding the alarm and emerging from the cockpit, they then discovered an open door – he had jumped and was nowhere to be seen.</p><p id=e5VIuq2sARsZ data-wc=1><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>The Most Hated Man on the Internet: where is Hunter Moore now?</a></strong></p><p id=eKwQ8yq-Cuca data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Black Bird: viewers saying same thing about Taron Egerton’s Apple TV drama</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/468d1b88078c-dbcooper-1-z.jpg><p id=eaiW1KsS0nsZ data-wc=6><strong>Have you seen the documentary yet?</strong></p><h2>What D.B. Cooper ever found?</h2><p id=ezCqCwQurgMX data-wc=45>Due to the crime taking place in 1970, the case of DB Cooper has always been an enormously difficult one to crack. Police techniques, such as DNA, were not around in that time and a body was never found – meaning the mystery lives on.</p><p id=eg5ao7Hp5d0i data-wc=42>It was also made difficult because although five aircraft were following the hijacked plane which was holding Cooper, none of them saw him jump due to the darkness, so the timing and location of his jump and subsequent landing is not known.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e695e5f29dd3-dbcooper-2-z.jpg><p id=eZYItWfg8tkj data-wc=5><strong>DB Cooper was never found</strong></p><p id=eP1aBaCgDHmL data-wc=34>By 1976, the FBI, who set up an investigation into the plane hijacking known as Norjack, had interviewed over 800 suspects as well as witnesses who claim that have met the real Dan Cooper.</p><p id=eSklHwqpzoZ9 data-wc=22>Eventually, after many more men become lead suspects but to no avail, the case was then dropped in 2016 and remains unsolved.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d1c7b44e4700-dbcooper-3-z.jpg><p id=eD7IfUMdV6PJ data-wc=7><strong>To this day, the case remains unsolved</strong></p><h2>What are the fans saying about Netflix's D.B.
