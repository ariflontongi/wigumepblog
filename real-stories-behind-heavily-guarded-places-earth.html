Both sides had their safeguards, and the Soviets' was a project called Perimeter, or more affectionately, <a href=#>Dead Hand</a>. It was a computer-driven system designed to send out inquiries to determine if there had been a nuclear strike on Soviet soil, and if the highest levels of military controls had been compromised or destroyed. If they had been, the system would send a request alert to one final failsafe. It was a person, sealed inside this bunker, watching and waiting for the lights to turn green. If they did, that person was tasked with pushing a button that would send all Soviet nukes toward their Western Hemisphere targets.</p><p>Sounds like the plot of some late-night science fiction movie, right? But it's real, and Wired even got to talk to one of the men who helped build the system, <a href=#>Valery Yarynich</a>. Once a member of the Soviet Strategic Rocket Forces and the Soviet General Staff, Yarynich said the system was built as a guarantee that even if a nuclear strike wiped out most of the Soviet command, they would still be able to strike back and, most likely, end the world. It had another purpose, too: to automate protocols that would need to be followed before button-pushers could get ahead of themselves.</p><p>The Dead Hand base was such a closely guarded secret that not only did the American government not know about it, but no Soviet civilians (including arms dealers) did, either. Russia's still <a href=#>not talking about it</a>, and it's unclear as to whether or not Dead Hand was ever taken offline.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BmG9ncGeimq6tedKtpquhlah6o7HHoqWdZZiarre1y7JkoK2Rp7GmsIypo5qblah6pq3RrZ9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-flash-star-grant-gustin-marries-fiancee-la-thoma.html><span>←</span><span>The Flash Star Grant Gustin Marries Fiancee LA Thoma</span></a>
