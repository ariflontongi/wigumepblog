heavy hitters in the world of professional sports.</span><span> We're talking </span><strong>three</strong><span> NFL teams:</span><span> the thrill-a-minute </span><strong>Jacksonville Jaguars</strong><span>,</span><span> the aqua-and-orange clad </span><strong>Miami Dolphins</strong><span>,</span><span> and the ever-optimistic </span><strong>Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong><span> (Tom Brady,</span><span> anyone?</span><span>).</span><span> Baseball fans can cheer on the </span><strong>Miami Marlins</strong><span> or the </span><strong>Tampa Bay Rays</strong><span>,</span><span> both with their own winning streaks and passionate followings.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:109><strong>But wait, there's more!</strong><span> Basketball's not left out,</span><span> with the slam-dunking </span><strong>Miami Heat</strong><span> and the alley-ooping </span><strong>Orlando Magic</strong><span> keeping the hardwood courts hot.</span><span> Hockey fans can get their ice fix with the speedy </span><strong>Florida Panthers</strong><span> and the ever-checking </span><strong>Tampa Bay Lightning</strong><span> (who might have a slight Stanley Cup addiction).</span></p><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:234><strong>Feeling overwhelmed?</strong><span> Don't worry,</span><span> we haven't even gotten to soccer (</span><strong>Orlando City SC</strong><span> and the

with sports extends far beyond the glitz and glam of the major leagues.</span><span> The state is crawling with </span><strong>minor league teams</strong><span> in baseball,</span><span> basketball,</span><span> hockey,</span><span> and even football (remember those arena football days?</span><span>).</span><span> These teams are often a breeding ground for future stars,</span><span>

league games are generally much cheaper than major league ones,</span><span> so you can enjoy the thrill of professional sports without breaking the bank (perfect for those post-vacation

nation.</span><span> It's safe to say that no matter what sport you fancy,</span><span> you'll find a team (or ten) to cheer for in the Sunshine State.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=23:1-23:139><strong>But hey, who's counting?</strong><span> As long as there's a game on,</span><span> a hot dog in hand,</span><span> and sunshine overhead,</span><span> that's all that truly matters,</span><span> right?</span></p><h2 data-sourcepos=25:1-25:57>Frequently Asked Sunshine State Sports Fan Questions:</h2><p data-sourcepos=27:1-28:124><strong>How to choose a team to
