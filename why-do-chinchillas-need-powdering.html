Chinchillas take dust baths as a way of self-cleaning their coats. This not only cleans their coats, but it protects them by eliminating extra oils and moisture. They will flop, flip, and roll around in the dust to cover their coat and remove any unwanted dirt or oils. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on kaytee.com</a><h2>Is chinchilla dust harmful to humans?</h2>Quality chinchilla dust should not contain any ingredients harmful to humans.

Additionally, chinchillas lack the natural oils in their skin that other animals have to repel water, so getting wet can be particularly harmful to them. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on quora.com</a><h2>Epic Chinchilla Dust Bath in 4k Ultra High Definition!</h2><h2>Can you reuse chinchilla dust?</h2>Put at least 2 inches of dust in the bottom of the container to make it deep enough for the chinchilla to properly bathe.
