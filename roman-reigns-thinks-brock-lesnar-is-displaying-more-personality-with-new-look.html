That changed at WWE SummerSlam,&nbsp;<a href=#>where he made his shocking return to WWE television</a>&nbsp;and confronted Roman Reigns. He officially came&nbsp;<a href=#>back as babyface</a>, much to the delight of fans. It seems Roman Reigns is a fan of Brock Lesnar’s new look.</p><p>Ever since Brock Lesnar came back, he showed off a&nbsp;<a href=#>Viking beard and ponytail</a> to completely change up his look. Brock Lesnar now has more of a lumberjack appearance and has been displaying a more relaxed and animated side of him. Fans are certainly enjoying his current run as well.</p><p>While speaking to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Complex</a>, Roman Reigns talked about Brock Lesnar’s current run in WWE. Reigns said that Lesnar looks more comfortable on TV than ever before. Reigns added that Lesnar has been displaying more personality as well.</p><p>“We got Brock the Butcher nowadays. You’ve seen a bit of evolution. We’re seeing him with different layers and presented in a different light. I think he’s more comfortable than he’s ever looked on screen, especially with him not having Paul [Heyman] in his corner to kind of lean on for the talking and the different responsibilities throughout the show outside of just suplexing people. I think he’s been able to display more of Brock Lesnar from a personality standpoint.”</p><p>Roman Reigns is set to defend his WWE Universal Championship against Brock Lesnar at WWE Crown Jewel on October 21st. <a href=#>Ringside News exclusively reported</a>&nbsp;that Roman Reigns and Brock Lesnar are set to have multiple matches this time around. It remains to be seen how their Crown Jewel match will play out.</p><p><strong>What’re your&nbsp;</strong><strong>thoughts on this story?
