It told the story of Sam coming to grips with the idea of him becoming Captain America as a Black man in America after his friend Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) retires.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The new film picks up with him fully into his new role as Cap. It’s directed by Julius Onah, and introduces Harrison Ford to the MCU, with the actor taking on the role of Thunderbolt Ross, previously played by the late William Hurt in other MCU projects. Danny Ramirez is back as Joaquin Torres, a young man who picks up the role of Falcon from Mackie’s Sam Wilson. Liv Tyler, Tim Blake Nelson, Carl Lumbly and Shira Haas also star.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The clip opens at the White House, where Sam Wilson has been summoned by Thunderbolt Ross, who is now president. He asks Sam to help him rebuild the Avengers. The footage then jumps to Ross thanking Captain America and Phoenix for helping with a crisis. Suddenly, loud music begins playing in the meeting, to Ross’ confusion. The music somehow manages to trigger something in former soldier Isiah Bradley, who attempts to kill the president. &nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The footage was of particular interest given that after several years of pumping out films and TV shows, Marvel has pulled back on its output in order to refocus and recalibrate. It only has one film out this year, with Deadpool & Wolverine arriving in July, and just two films next year. Captain America 4 arrives Feb. 14, 2025, while Fantastic Four follows July 25, 2025.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">At the end of the clip was a sizzle reel, with Ross telling Sam, “You’re not Steve Rogers.” Sam responds, “I’m not.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKStz62YoqZdlrqmvsicmGaaopbDpnnNnq5mr5%2BnuaV5wKeroaeernqurcKkoJ5lYWeAdoSWa2pua18%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aric-almirola-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-2-html.html><span>←</span><span>Aric Almirola Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
