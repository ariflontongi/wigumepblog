Land of diners, dreamy boardwalks, and...a fierce competition for closest neighbor to the Big Apple. Let's face it, folks in Jersey want that bragging right (and maybe a quicker commute to all those fancy Manhattan jobs). So, buckle up, because we're about to dive into the hilarious (and highly subjective) world of New Jersey's "close call" contenders.</p><p data-sourcepos=5:1-5:37><strong>Frontrunners: The Gold Coast Crew</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:485>This shiny trio - <strong>Jersey City, Hoboken, and Weehawken</strong> - are practically spitting distance from NYC. You can practically smell the hot dog stands from Times Square on a clear day. They boast stunning skyline views (perfect for your Instagram aesthetic), and a quick PATH train ride lands you right in the heart of the action. But here's the thing, with great proximity comes great responsibility...responsibility to pay a slightly higher rent than your aunt Shirley in Hackensack.</p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:282><strong>Weehawken:</strong> This little town is like the hipster cousin of Hoboken. It's got a cool, artsy vibe and a waterfront park with a million-dollar view of the city (without the million-dollar rent, win!). Just be prepared to explain how to pronounce it to outsiders ("Wee-what-now?").</p><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:290><strong>Hoboken:</strong> Ah, Hoboken. The OG of NJ close calls. This little mile-square city is a bustling hub with a bar on every corner and enough restaurants to keep your tastebuds happy for a decade. Just be prepared to fight crowds on the weekend - everyone wants a piece of the Hoboken action.</p><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:290><strong>Jersey City:</strong> The biggest of the bunch, Jersey City offers a little bit of everything - from historic neighborhoods to trendy spots. Plus, you get your pick of subway lines and the iconic PATH train, making NYC practically an extension of your living room (well, maybe a long hallway).</p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:53><strong>The Wildcards: Don't Count These Jersey Joes Out!</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:168>Now, don't go writing off the other contenders just yet. There are some hidden gems in the Jersey landscape that offer their own charm and surprising proximity to NYC.</p><p data-sourcepos=19:1-19:213><strong>Fort Lee:</strong> This town boasts the <strong>George Washington Bridge</strong>, which is basically a scenic entrance to NYC. It's also got some fantastic Korean BBQ spots, so you can carbo-load before (or after) your commute.</p><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:280><strong>Edgewater:</strong> If waterfront living is your jam, then Edgewater is calling your name. This little town offers some seriously swanky apartments with jaw-dropping river views. Just be prepared to explain to your friends why your commute involves a ferry ride (it's an adventure!).</p><p data-sourcepos=23:1-23:204><strong>Union City:</strong> Looking for a vibrant, multicultural experience? Union City is your spot. This town is buzzing with energy and offers a fantastic view of the NYC skyline (without the Hoboken price tag).</p><p data-sourcepos=25:1-25:41><strong>The Verdict: It's All Relative, Baby!</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=27:1-27:223>So, which New Jersey city is the closest to NYC? The truth is, it depends on your priorities. Do you crave a quick commute and killer views? Or are you more on a budget and down for a little adventure (like a ferry ride)?</p><p data-sourcepos=29:1-29:235>Ultimately, the best Jersey city for you is the one that feels closest to your heart (and maybe your wallet). So, get out there, explore, and find your own little slice of New Jersey paradise (with a side of NYC access, of course).</p>1212932835738265128<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maWxfrLWiwIycoK2xXZ67brrEsGSjnaKosrp5yKxknKSfqLK0wIytpmegpKK5</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wga-awards-2014-winners-676344.html><span>←</span><span>WGA Awards 2014: The Winners</span></a>
