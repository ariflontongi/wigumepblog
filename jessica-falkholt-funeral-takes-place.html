"Whenever asking how long it would take to drive somewhere I would suggest an average for a normal driver and then add some additional time for the Lars factor. We always had a good laugh." Speaking about his sister Vivian, he added: "I always thought we would grow old together. They are together and always will be ... You will always be remembered and in our hearts forever.
