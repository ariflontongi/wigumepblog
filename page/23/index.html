Answer
A Burmese Tiger Pit is a traditional trap that has been used in both hunting and warfare for centuries. A sand pit is essentially a deep trench, frequently more than ten feet deep, that is lined with sharp spikes at the bottom and covered with some weak material, such as branches or a tarp that has been coated with soil.
