She scored 284 on her first JAMB, but couldn't get into Unilag to study medicine. The next year, she scored 320, but still no admission into Unilag (I can't explain it). I couldn't just sit back and watch her talent go to waste. So, I got her to take the SAT exam. She prepped for only two weeks and scored 1450. We started applying for scholarships in the US, and she got two fully funded scholarships and one partial one. Last week, she went for her visa interview. In a few months, she’ll be heading to the United States. 1. I am still confused that she couldn't get into Unilag. Something is definitely wrong with our system. 2. I am happy she is going to somewhere she can truly shine and explore her full potential. 3. It's a shame we keep losing our brightest minds. 4. To be successful, you need opportunity, information and access."<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/81fb7966c13c8e2a.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Law student in 200 level at UNIZIK Awka writes JAMB again after discovering her admission was fake</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>See the X post:</strong></p><h2>Lady gets scholarship to study abroad</h2><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, <strong>Legit.ng</strong> earlier reported that a Nigerian lady received a scholarship to pursue her studies in Finland and narrated her journey, which swiftly captured the attention of <a href=#>TikTok</a> users.</p><p class=align-left>In her video, she expressed her enthusiasm while preparing for her relocation to the overseas nation.</p><p class=align-left>Subsequently, <a href=#>she revealed her</a> arrival in Finland through a clip that depicted her disembarking from the bus and stepping into the city, as shown by @sophieonuh.</p><p class=align-left>In a recent development, <strong>Legit.ng</strong> also reported that a Nigerian lady, Oluwakemi Bayode, is currently in the United States after <a href=#>she bagged </a>a fully funded overseas scholarship.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkvaa7z6WcaGllboB5gI9mpaKflae2orqMrKuunJWjwW671Z6pnKedmsBuwc2irZ6qo57BunnAnaSiq6OevK95w56lopmcYsCmr9SrnKxllqq5rXnSnJ%2BopJGnwKm1z6xkrqtf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nickelodeon-kids-choice-sports-awards-2018-complete-list-winners-1120359.html><span>←</span><span>Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Sports Awards 2018: Complete List of Winners</span></a>
