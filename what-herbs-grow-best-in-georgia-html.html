Posse</h3><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:231><span>First things first,</span><span> Georgia gets plenty of sunshine.</span><span> </span><strong>Most herbs are sun-worshippers</strong><span>,</span><span> so give them a spot that gets at least 6-8 hours of sunlight a day.</span><span> Here are some superstars that will thrive in your sunny Georgia paradise:</span></p><ul data-sourcepos=11:1-12:105><li data-sourcepos=11:1-11:146><strong>Basil:</strong><span> The king of pesto (and Caprese salads,</span><span> don't forget!</span><span>),</span><span> basil needs all that sunshine to develop its signature sweet,</span><span> peppery flavor.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=12:1-12:105><strong>Rosemary:</strong><span> This woody wonder adds a delightful piney touch to meats,</span><span> stews,</span><span> and even focaccia bread.</span><span> Just remember,</span><span> rosemary's a bit of a diva and likes its soil on the drier side.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=13:1-14:0><strong>Oregano:</strong><span> The foundation of many Italian dishes,</span><span> oregano is a low-maintenance herb that will happily bask in the Georgia sun.</span></li></ul><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:140><span>But hey,</span><span> not all heroes wear capes (or bask in sunshine).</span><span> There are a few </span><strong>shade-loving herbs</strong><span> that will appreciate a break from the heat:</span></p><ul data-sourcepos=17:1-20:0><li data-sourcepos=17:1-17:224><strong>Mint:</strong><span> This fast-growing herb is practically unstoppable,</span><span> but it prefers a little afternoon shade to keep its leaves from getting crispy.</span><span> Just be warned,</span><span> mint can be invasive,</span><span> so plant it in a pot to keep it contained.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=18:1-18:187><strong>Cilantro:</strong><span> The bright,</span><span> citrusy flavor of cilantro is a must-have for many Asian and Latin American dishes.</span><span> Give it some morning sun and afternoon shade,</span><span> and it'll be happy as a clam.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=19:1-20:0><strong>Parsley:</strong><span> A versatile garnish and flavor booster,</span><span> parsley can handle a little shade,</span><span> but it won't complain about some morning sun either.</span></li></ul><h3

tips to keep them thriving:</span></p><ul data-sourcepos=25:1-28:0><li data-sourcepos=25:1-25:144><strong>Soil Savvy:</strong><span> Most herbs prefer well-drained,</span><span> loose soil.</span><span> If your Georgia clay is a little heavy,</span><span> add some sand or compost to lighten it up.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=26:1-26:189><strong>Watering Wisdom:</strong><span> Don't drown your herbs!</span><span> Most prefer moist soil,</span><span> but not soggy feet.</span><span> Water deeply when the top inch of soil feels dry,</span><span> then let it dry out a bit before watering again.</span></li><li data-sourcepos=27:1-28:0><strong>Harvest Happy:</strong><span> Clip those leaves regularly to encourage bushier growth.</span><span> Pinch off the flower buds too,</span><span> to keep the plant focusing on foliage,</span><span> not reproduction.</span></li></ul><h3 data-sourcepos=29:1-29:43>FAQ: Mastering Your Georgia Herb Garden</h3><p
