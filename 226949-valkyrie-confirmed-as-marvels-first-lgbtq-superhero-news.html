She has some ideas. Keep you posted.” For those who didn't catch the star's vague reveal,&nbsp;Feige later confirmed what Thompson had been hinting at. “The answer is yes,” Feige said on the matter&nbsp;of including an LBTQ element within Valkyrie's storyline. “How that impacts the story remains to be seen with that level of representation you’ll see across our films, not in just&nbsp;Thor 4.” In an interview with&nbsp;Rolling Stone back&nbsp;in October of 2017, Thompson&nbsp;briefly touched upon Valkyrie's sexuality, revealing that&nbsp;director Taika Waititi initially pitched her character as being bisexual - as she&nbsp;appears in the comics - when she made her debut in&nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok.&nbsp;Thor: Love and Thunder&nbsp;will hit theatres on November 5th, 2021, and will see the return of the film's&nbsp;protagonist, played once more by the beloved&nbsp;Chris Hemsworth,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Natalie Portman&nbsp;as the new female Thor.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdiZ4N6gJhmrZqkm66%2FqrGMnKannpmnuqawjJqqZqWRp8OmuNJmnaKqo6l6rbPBrahmq6WlsrO0xKumZqaVrMA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tyler-james-williams-net-worth-2024-2.html><span>←</span><span>Tyler James Williams Net Worth 2024</span></a>
