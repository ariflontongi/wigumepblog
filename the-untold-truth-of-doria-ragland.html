A source told People, "Meghan didn't have much when she was a child, but her mom made sure they always gave back."</p><p dir=ltr>And on her (now defunct) blog <a href=#>The Tig</a>, Meghan wrote, "My mother raised me to be a global citizen, with eyes open to sometimes harsh realities. I must have been about 10 years old when we visited the slums of Jamaica. I had never seen poverty at that level and it registered in my glazed brown eyes. 'Don't look scared, Flower,' she said. 'Be aware, but don't be afraid.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGxpan9ze9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5w6ipopldp66ouMCnm2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-most-uncomfortable-moments-at-celeb-funerals.html><span>←</span><span>The Most Uncomfortable Moments At Celeb Funerals</span></a>
