The singer has been suffering from a nasty throat infection, and instead had to rest at home. After making a statement on social media to let his fans know, the star has since posted a far more upbeat message on Twitter. On Tuesday evening, the singer shared a throwback picture of himself wearing a bright yellow shirt, and captioned it: "They should have called me Mellow Yellow, don't cha think?" Fans were quick to respond to the post, with many wishing Rod a speedy recovery. "Is it your favourite colour Rod? Keep yourself warm and get well," one wrote, while another added: "Hear you are under the weather, get well soon."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/32054f2130cf-rod-stewart-breaks-silence-health-concern-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=erbdQOg2vwM data-wc=10><strong>Rod Stewart has shared an uplifting post following his illness</strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p style=text-align:center id=eEd5GcAP0eAi data-wc=6><strong>Watch Rod Stewart surprise D-Day veterans</strong></p><p id=e097IXEXIoCL data-wc=81>The hitmaker had admitted that he was devastated to not be performing at the Royal Variety Performance.

Rod's health concern follows just two months after he opened up about his secret three-year battle with prostate cancer. The 74-year-old singer was diagnosed with the illness in February 2016 during a routine check-up, and opened up about his cancer fight during a fundraising event for the Prostate Project in Surrey in September. "No one knows this, but I thought this was about time I told everybody. I'm in the clear, now, simply because I caught it early. I have so many tests," he shared.</p><p id=eLup9GuT7mVg data-wc=1><strong>READ:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Catherine Zeta-Jones shares wedding picture to celebrate anniversary</a></p><p id=emGucB72526Q data-wc=102>In October, Rod's wife Penny Lancaster opened up about the impact his cancer diagnosis had on their family during an appearance on . The mother-of-two broke down in tears as she explained why they kept the diagnosis a secret from the world for nearly three years. "It was our choice to come out [with the news], as it were. Rod was performing at a prostate cancer event with the Faces," she explained. "After a few songs he said, 'Hi everyone, thank you so much for coming and I have to just take this moment, I owe it to everyone, I'm a survivor.""</p><p id=eDR6wHaOSKRu data-wc=62>The couple only shared the news with their older children first. "We told the older ones… It would be too much for them [the younger ones] to understand," explained Penny. "When daddy finally told everybody the good news, and to get the message out there for guys out there over 50 go and get the test, then we told the little ones."</p><p id=e8kgaWwIdAbq data-wc=14></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
