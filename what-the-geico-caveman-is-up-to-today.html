This Geico ad concept was gold for the company and consumers, so they needed more actors. This is where McManus Woodend came in. <a href=#>Courier & Press</a> reported that Woodend beat out 1,000 actors auditioning for the role and started his work as a Geico Caveman in 2009. A lot of the Geico commercials on his <a href=#>resume</a> are brand partnerships, such as the History Channel or the NHL. Courier & Press reported that one of his first shoots was for the Discovery Channel and its show "The Deadliest Catch," meaning he had to be in some gnarly weather from the jump. Woodend also did in-person appearances as the Geico Caveman. Seven of his Geico Caveman videos are on <a href=#>his website</a>, with a popular TV spot being the curling Geico Cavemen commercial. He has over 20 TV spots on his resume for the company and portrayed that character for nearly a decade.</p><p dir=ltr>But imagine taking classes from a former Geico Caveman. No, this isn't another Geico ad idea, but instead the newest career path for Woodend. Courier & Press reported in November 2022 that Woodend was in his first semester teaching English at the University of Southern Indiana. "It's definitely in my blood," he said. "I have a lot of friends in the teaching profession."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlgbH5yfo6wn5qsXam1pnnGnqCcp12YrrexzJqlZqGjYsKxedOoZK2nlJbGcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1308171-what-reverse-psychology-definition-examples-html.html><span>←</span><span>What is reverse psychology: Definition and examples</span></a>
