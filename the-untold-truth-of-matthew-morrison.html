Having spent a few summers in Hawaii when he was a teenager as a backup singer for "Tiny Bubbles" singer Don Ho, Morrison decided to respond accordingly. "I said, 'How is it, sistah?' and she laughed. The rest is history,"&nbsp;he told the <a href=#>New York Post</a>&nbsp;of how he met Renee Puente.</p><p>As he recalled for&nbsp;<a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, "Renee and I fell in love quickly,&nbsp;and three months later she was living on a tour bus with me."&nbsp;In 2014, Morrison <a href=#>tweeted</a>&nbsp;that they had tied the knot in Hawaii, even <a href=#>sharing a photo</a> of the newlyweds. Puente, Morrison told the Post, isn't bothered by his romantic past from before they met. "Honestly, she loves the fact that I went through all that — a lot of relationships, some one-night stands. I learned a lot about who I was and, more importantly, the person I wanted to be with,"&nbsp;he explained. "My wife came into my life at such a great time."&nbsp;</p><p>When Morrison parted ways with "So You Think You Can Dance," Puente proved to have his back when she <a href=#>reposted his Instagram video</a> along with a message of her own.&nbsp;She wrote, in part, "My husband has finally been given an opportunity to speak his truth. He has done so&nbsp;with such grace and integrity in a situation that is complex and incredibly complicated."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcXFmbH55e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5zJqrraCVrHquu9GroKynnmQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./aizhai-suspension-bridge-china-pictures.html><span>←</span><span>The Aizhai suspension bridge in China in pictures | World news</span></a>
