Designer Elizabeth Emanuel, the woman behind the original 1981 dress, explained that she's going to design a new dress that captures the magic of the original and that she's going to "climb back into the time machine" and create a new gown that's an update to the dress that we all know and love.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I’m going to try and capture the spirit of the original — but through my eyes now," Emanuel told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>. "I want to preserve all the sparkles and pearls but with a completely different vision."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Diana originally wore the dress during her wedding ceremony at St. Paul’s Cathedral in London on July 29, 1981. Instantly, the puff sleeves and super-long train became trademarks of bridal fashion for an entire decade. Diana's dress had a 25-foot train, which cascaded down the church steps in now-iconic photos from the day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's a really exciting thing because I often get asked, 'Would you do the same dress again?' Well, I wouldn't change a thing on the dress in 1981, but if I was looking at it through my eyes now, there's so many possibilities," Emanuel continued.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Anwar Hussein/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The designer revealed that ahead of Diana's wedding, she created a second dress, just in case.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was a bit neurotic, and I thought, 'What happens if somebody breaks in and steals the dress or something spills or there’s a fire or it gets stolen?'" she shared. "So, I thought, 'I’m gonna make a backup dress.'" There were a few differences, however, including the color, which was white and "not the deep ivory that the royal wedding dress was made of." Diana's dress had the now-signature puffed sleeves, but Emanuel revealed that the backup had "slim ones, more fitted to her arms."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Emanuel hasn't shared a timeline for the new creation, but she did reproduce that second, never-before-worn dress for the&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>virtual Princess Diana Museum</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We never got to see that dress on Diana and thought it would be lovely to envision it," Renae Plant, the museum’s director and curator, said.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57z6ugp5uVqMBusMiapZplp5qxpbXNoGSdqpWowG6%2FxKqsnqRdmrmqxsCbnK2gXZq6orrUnqNmcGZngXV9lA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./peso-pluma-height-how-tall-is-peso-pluma-html.html><span>←</span><span>Peso Pluma Height | How Tall is Peso Pluma?</span></a>
