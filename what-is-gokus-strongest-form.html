Let's face it: It's still not over yet. We saw a multi-verse tournament, yes, we saw Goku learning slowly how to master the Ultra Instinct technique, which in the end led him to become the white-haired mortal who mastered it.<h2>What's the highest level Goku reaches?</h2>According to some fan sites, this transformation allows him to reach a reported power level of 13.2 septillion! However, the highest power level reported by any official sources is the 150,000,000 Goku achieves when leveling up to Super Saiyan.<h2>Who can beat Zeno?</h2><p>10 anime characters who could successfully take on Zeno</p><ul><li>Tenchi Masaki talking to his Godly form (Image via AIC)</li><li>Truth grinning (Image via Viz Media)</li><li>Lain Iwakura (Image via Triangle Staff)</li><li>Hajun (Image via Funimation)</li><li>Featherine Augustus Aurora (Image via Studio Dean)</li></ul><h2>Who created Zeno?</h2>So far we've talked about how Zeno is incredibly powerful. And yet he is still not the most powerful. That credit goes to Tori-Bot, the in-universe representation of the series creator Akira Toriyama.<h2>How old is Zeno?</h2>7 Zeno (Over 8.5 Million Years)<h2>Why is Grand Zeno a child?</h2>Although it has not been confirmed, there is a popular theory amongst the Dragon Ball fanbase that answers this question. It says Grand Zeno has a child-like personality since his apparent innocence perpetuates a sense of neutrality. Being neutral is very important, especially as the Omni-King.<h2>What is Goku's max power?</h2>The highest power level ever officially stated in the Daizenshuu guides is Super Saiyan Goku's power level of 150,000,000 while battling Frieza on Namek. The overall highest power level officially stated was 5,300,000,000 for Frieza's power level in Dragon Ball Z: The Real 4-D.<h2>What's Goku's full power?</h2>Super Saiyan 3 Goku at full power has a battle power of 24,000,000,000, 2 billion above Kid Buu's level.<h2>What is Goku's top speed?</h2>Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot estimates that Goku's power levels are around 10 billion as of the Babidi Saga. By applying the same formula, this means that Goku, without Instant Transmission, can travel 22.321 trillion MPH -- or 33,314 times the speed of light!<h2>Who created ultra instinct?</h2>Creation and Conception<p>According to an interview, Akira Toriyama designed Ultra Instinct — including its name — as a power-up for Son Gokū that would be distinct from the Super Saiyan form. It was only decided after the flow of the Universe Survival Arc's story had been decided on.</p><h2>What is Super Saiyan 100?</h2>Super Saiyan 100 ( 超スーパーサイヤ人じん 100 Sūpā Saiya-jin Hyaku ) is the infamous fan transformation of the Saiyan race as well as the most powerful transformation in the Saiyan race if not the entire Dragon Ball universe. It's ridiculous and somewhat accurate concept led to its virality.<h2>What is above ultra instinct?</h2>Will there be a higher level beyond Ultra Instinct? The Angels, Grand Priest, Zeno and Zarama may have ki beyond god. If that is the case then there is a good chance that Goku and Vegeta will try to attain it as well.<h2>What is the strongest saiyan form?</h2>1 Perfected Ultra Instinct<p>This is the newest and most powerful form a Saiyan has ever been shown to achieve and is a fitting way to close out the Dragon Ball Super series. In this form, Goku's hair and eyes are completely grey. His power is level gains a huge boost, though it is extremely damaging to his body.</p><h2>Are half Saiyans stronger?</h2>Yes, without a doubt half blood Saiyans are stronger than full blood Saiyans because even Goku had to admit that Gohan was stronger than him and Vegeta in Dragon Ball Super.<h2>Who is stronger Goku or Broly?</h2>Broly is stronger than Goku, however, Perfected Super Saiyan Blue Gogeta is superior to Broly.<h2>What is ultra instinct Gokus power level?</h2>It shows Ultra-Instinct Son Goku in black hair with the power level of 9000. In addition, Jiren the Gray is shown to have a power level of 9,5000. The card also reveals Son Goku in his perfect Ultra-Instinct form.<h2>Who is stronger than Goku?</h2>1) Jiren. As seen in Dragon Ball Super's Tournament of Power arc, Goku was unable to defeat Jiren in a 1v1 even after achieving Mastered Ultra Instinct. While Goku has honed his Ultra Instinct since the Tournament of Power in the manga, Jiren and Goku have yet to rematch as Goku is now.<h2>Is Goku universe level?</h2>Super Saiyan God Goku is NOT a universe buster but he is universal | Fandom.<h2>What is Zeno true form?</h2>When using his true power, Zeno can achieve true omnipotence. Omnipotence: As the Omni-King of the 1st Multiverse, Zeno has the ability to be almighty in every sense and aspect. Zeno can achieve and do absolutely anything without any limit or condition as he is one of the most powerful Gods.<h2>Can Super Dragon Ball erase Zeno?</h2>Yes, Zeno erased Zamasu and all of Future Trunks's timeline's universes.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lmah6qLvKrqpmq6SnvK%2BzxKyrZp6fp7o%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-age-is-shigaraki.html><span>←</span><span>What age is Shigaraki?</span></a>
