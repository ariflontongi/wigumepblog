Besides, we should know the extent of the continental territories at relatively high latitude, leading to strong cooling in winter. One more important fact is the proximity of The Arctic Ocean, which makes the summer cool.</p><p class=align-left>The Canadian climate is characterized by a cold winter and a cool or moderate and humid summer with a long day. The climate and temperatures vary greatly depending on the region. In the north the climate is polar. In Prairies, the temperature range varies at different times of the year or even days. But speaking of the climate in the west, in British Columbia, it is milder and more temperate. It is not overlooked by the Canadian Rockies. On the west coast and the island of Vancouver, there is the marine climate. Winters are mild and rainy due to the influence of the Pacific Ocean.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/669e29c81905a37b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is the hottest country in the world now?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/669e29c81905a37b.jpg><p class=align-left>The average monthly winter temperature can drop to -15°C even in the southern part of the country. But you can expect temperatures of -40°C with strong icy winds. An average annual precipitation in the form of snow can reach several hundred centimeters. For example, in Quebec - 337 cm.</p><p class=align-left>In summer, the actual temperatures can rise to +35°C, and in the Canadian Prairies even up to +40°C. The humidity index is often high in summer in the east of the country. In some villages in the extreme north of the country, temperatures were fixed to -50°C in winter. The temperature in Alert in summer rarely reaches +5°C. In addition, strong icy winds can dramatically lower the temperature even to -60°C.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1a6prfpmsvg.jpg><p class=align-left>In most of the territory, the climate is continental. It is cold or very cold in winter, like Dxx according to Köppen's classification. In the southern part close to the US border, the summer is relatively warmer and longer, in the north it is shorter and cooler.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7ca148d755fc8e64.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How many seasons do we have in Nigeria?</span></p></a><h3>Which continent is Canada?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5ieub2ae32f.jpg><p class=align-left>Canada is the continent of North America.

Quebec is the province with a predominant French-speaking population. The rest are mainly English-speaking provinces, also called "English Canada" in comparison with the French-speaking Quebec.</p><p class=align-left>As one of the nine predominantly English-speaking provinces, New Brunswick is the only officially bilingual Canadian province. The territory of the Yukon is officially bilingual (English and French), and the Northwest Territories and the Nunavut Territory recognize 11 and 4 official languages respectively. English and French are also present among them.</p><h2>Where is Canada?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4n3d6slq1a8.jpg><p class=align-left>Speaking more about the geographical position of Canada, it should be noted that the country occupies a large part of the North of North America. The zone of the north is about 75%. Canada has a common land border with the USA in the south and in the northwest (between Alaska and Yukon).
