Because of his injury, <a href=#>he wasn’t able to compete at this year’s Royal Rumble</a> either and now Big E revealed if he felt left out because of that.</p><p>Big E has been on the shelf since the March 11, 2022&nbsp;episode of WWE SmackDown, <a href=#>where he suffered a&nbsp;broken neck</a>. It has been almost two years since the injury and in the meantime, Big E has made numerous appearances on a variety of shows</p><p>While speaking to <a href=#>Denise Salcedo</a>, Big E was asked if he felt left out by not being able to compete in the Royal Rumble match last week. Big E mentioned that he is using this time to view the product as a fan and enjoy the performances of his colleagues and didn’t feel left out by his absence at all.</p><p>“No. I think it’s really cool just to see the past couple years. As performers, we’re so often in the mold of what’s next. We’re always thinking about our career. But the nice thing is since I’ve been out I’ve been able to just sit back and be a fan of people and see kind of the lay of the land. It’s nice to be excited for people like Jade, for Liv coming back. Just so many of my favorite people. So for me, I don’t have any weird feelings about not being in myself. It’s just cool to root for my friends and people who I think are really talented.”</p><p>Big E also expressed his joy at being back in the fold for an event like the Royal Rumble. He likened the experience to a big reunion, stating how he doesn’t regularly see many people he has known for a long time.</p><p>“It’s really cool. For me honestly it feels like a big reunion because I’m not on the road regularly. So a lot of the people that I’ve known for quite some time, I don’t get to see all the time. So it’s just nice and especially for big events like this, for WrestleMania when you see so many people you haven’t seen in so long. It’s just nice. We are in many ways, a big travelling circus. So an opportunity for us to all get together again is really lovely. To do it just down the street from where I live. This is my community. I live in Land O’Lakes in the Tampa area. So it’s been beautiful to see all the love and excitement just around my city.”</p><p>Big E is focused on the many things happening in his life, and that’s what matters most to him at the moment. Whether or not his time in the ring continues, fans will always appreciate and celebrate the accomplishments he has achieved throughout his career.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Given Big E’s positive perspective on his absence from WWE due to his neck injury, how do you think his experience of being a fan and supporting his colleagues during his time away from the ring might influence his perspective and approach to his career when he eventually returns to active competition?
