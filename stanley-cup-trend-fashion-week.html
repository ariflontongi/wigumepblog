It wasn’t a new intrecciato Bottega bag handcrafted in some storied factory in Italy. Nor was it a butter-soft leather jacket from the latest Phoebe Philo drop, with a price tag equivalent to a mortgage payment. No, it was a pale pink 40-ounce Stanley Cup with a thick protruding straw, officially named the Adventure Quencher H2.0 Travel Tumbler, that retails for $45. Okay, maybe it wasn’t the hottest thing at Fashion Week, but it certainly has been the hottest accessory on social media.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Stanley, an American food-and-beverage container company whose founder invented all-steel vacuum-insulated bottles over a century ago in Massachusetts, has seen its chuggers blow up on TikTok this winter. The brand recently collaborated with Starbucks on a collection of searing pink and red cups so popular they have become a new target for scalpers—selling on StockX, a platform typically reserved for rare sneakers, for $250 and up. (I found one on eBay for $355, whose description included the assurance “CUP IN HAND! I am selling the cup. There are a lot of scammers on eBay trying to sell pictures of the cup. Don’t be fooled!”)</p><p><h2 class="css-19ilr8l e1bddzxd0">Stanley Quencher H2.0 Travel Tumbler</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$38 at Amazon for Quencher H2.0 Travel Tumbler" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BNX6K3T8 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BNX6K3T8 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BNX6K3T8?tag=harpersbazaar_auto-append-20" data-affiliate-network='{"afflink_redirect":"/afflink/br1U/amazon-stanley-quencher-h2-0-flowstate-stainless","site_id":"229d0812-d901-44db-87b0-24674345b9e5","network":{"name":"Amazon"}}' data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$38 at Amazon" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BNX6K3T8 data-vars-ga-product-brand=Stanley data-vars-ga-product-id=827743f8-e1a1-48a3-963d-8f15dc2148ce data-vars-ga-product-price=$38.47 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=06fd2631-0f06-45fb-981a-6a25c16406d9 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand=STANLEY data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=B0BNX6K3T8 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-g6od0w e1c1bym14"><img alt="Quencher H2.0 Travel Tumbler" title="Quencher H2.0 Travel Tumbler" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1689885752-515SFP7ai3L.jpg width=903 height=2000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The recycled-aluminum vessel has inspired countless think pieces and mini investigations, including pieces in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/how-the-stanley-cup-went-viral data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New Yorker" data-vars-ga-product-id=421f9f3a-2bc3-4f0f-810c-dc6b5316168d data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/how-the-stanley-cup-went-viral data-product-url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/how-the-stanley-cup-went-viral data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-url data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=beb23e82-a025-4e76-9b79-fd42afe7ec55 class="body-link product-links css-1xesb7e e1aq0z090">The New Yorker</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/style/stanley-tumbler.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New York Times" data-vars-ga-product-id=0ff69435-74be-4d9b-bd1c-aa42bbbb3c5a data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/style/stanley-tumbler.html data-product-url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/style/stanley-tumbler.html data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-url data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=2da1a78a-f4c4-441a-b4a5-179ef79feca4 class="body-link product-links css-1xesb7e e1aq0z090">The New York Times</a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/01/stanley-cups-valentines-day-target-starbucks/677190/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Atlantic" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">The Atlantic</a>, all attempting to trace and make sense of its viral popularity. The official Stanley TikTok has a fun way of integrating the brand’s fans into its feed: In one video, viewed over 56.6 million times, a woman shows how her car was damaged when it caught on fire—but the Stanley Cup has remains intact in its cup holder. (Stanley later gifted her a new car, and also shared that online.)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The rabid obsession with the cup has translated to big-time moolah, too, of course. Stanley’s revenue increased from $73 million in 2019 to a whopping $750 million in 2023, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/23/how-a-40-ounce-cup-turned-stanley-into-a-750-million-a-year-business.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to CNBC" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">according to CNBC</a>.</p><img alt="a person in a garment" title="a person in a garment" width=1440 height=1920 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/3c3964c7-2958-4cb3-85d0-bde2b143b67f-jpg-65cfe48223856.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Liana Satenstein</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The craze over the zaftig mug is taking place very much outside of fashion’s epicenters. One video I saw on TikTok showed a ferocious pilgrimage to Target for an exclusive Starbucks x Stanley Cup drop—a postapocalyptic-looking mob of women running toward their goodies like New Yorkers at a sample sale for the Row. And the cup is great for chugging from in an SUV, its plump container resting easy in a cup holder, and makes sense slapped down on an office desk.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But what about its fashion appeal? Is it comfortable to haul along to a fashion show? And more importantly, does it hold up as any kind of status symbol there? Would sipping sink water from it while sitting front row at Thom Browne, watching model Alex Consani shed a jacket that took months to hand-stitch, to a recitation of Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven,” enhance the Stanley Cup’s power or diminish it? If no one notices your Stanley Cup, do you even have one? Or if they do notice it and hate it, what does that mean?</p><img alt="a person wearing a garment" title="a person wearing a garment" width=1440 height=1920 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/6b5abbf3-1fed-4ee3-a539-c94f5f6ad8bc-jpg-65cfe4e5da838.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Liana Satenstein</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">My first day with my new appendage, I took an electric Citi Bike from south Brooklyn to the Eckhaus Latta show in TriBeCa with it nestled—except for the straw—into my vintage Y2K-era Louis Vuitton Multipli Cite bag. At stoplights, I’d lean over and take a swig. By the time I got to the show, a thin layer of water was sloshing around in the cap. No big deal.</p><img alt="graphical user interface, website" title="graphical user interface, website" width=1179 height=2556 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-6818-png-65cfe715e37fd.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Liana Satenstein</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The real tidal wave of commotion was when I entered the building. A small group of friends and colleagues swarmed me when they saw the top of the Stanley Cup poking out from my bag, like a swaddled newborn peeking its tiny head from a blanket. Cue the cries of “Is that a Stanley Cup?” and “I cannot.” I relished the attention so much that by the end of the show, I was carrying it around with pride, like a trophy.</p><img alt="a person lying on the ground with a hat and a cigarette" title="a person lying on the ground with a hat and a cigarette" width=1056 height=1412 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2024-02-16-at-5-45-16-pm-65cfe592ae559.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Liana Satenstein</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The next day, I checked what other bags I had in my carryall arsenal. Was it possible to chic-ify the Stanley Cup? I grabbed a Michael Kors–era Celine PVC tote from spring 2000—a collection that essentially revolves around a vision of an oligarch’s hot-bodied sidepiece stepping off of a helicopter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I plopped my filled-to-the-brim cup into the clear bag and headed out to Fashion Week again, showing off the Stanley’s buxom steel bod to everyone I passed.</p><img alt="a person holding a plate" title="a person holding a plate" width=1062 height=1404 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2024-02-16-at-5-48-18-pm-65cfe64157887.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Liana Satenstein</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And it was a hit—a mini celebrity, or maybe a sideshow freak. Showgoers loved to take photos of it. Interview editor Taylore Scarabelli gleefully wrote “subverting the basic bitch” in response to a photo of me sipping from it. She has a point. The Stanley Cup has so far been relegated to mass-market basic bitch–dom. But there is always a chance it might be on the arms of downtown girlies or runways in a few seasons.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fashion has a history of glomming onto ironic trends and transforming them into something cheeky and sophisticated. The Ugg craze seeped its way from sororities onto the feet of style stars and later into integrations with brands: Telfar, Y/Project, and Collina Strada have all released their own iterations of the sheepskin boot. And Crocs went from the hooves of chef Mario Batali to the runways of Balenciaga (where the bulbous resinous closed-toe sandals were transformed with violent girthy platforms and adorned with brutalist spikes) and Simone Rocha (where they were twisted into a confectionary, bedazzled lady clog). The fashion potential might be even realer than you think: Former Crocs chief marketing officer Terence Reilly is now global president of Stanley.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bringing the Stanley Cup to Fashion Week was, admittedly, a party trick—a conversation starter, and one dripping with irony at that. Perhaps, though, I’m just an early adopter of the fashion world’s next obsession. Maybe a collaboration with a designer is coming in the near future. After all, the cup could serve as an incredible easel to be freaked with—a tabula rasa of sorts, and a heritage item in its own right. Fashion is always thirsty, after all. Drink up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfm660tMiopWiZZGuFc3%2BUcWxoq6SWu62x2Gaarqhdqb%2BmusNmnZqrmJ68r3nWnpykZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-shop-gap-dapper-dan-hoodie.html><span>←</span><span>How to Shop the Gap and Dapper Dan Hoodie Before It Sells Out Again</span></a>
