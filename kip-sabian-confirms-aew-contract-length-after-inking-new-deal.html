Even introducing a new gimmick hasn’t done him any wonders. Sabian signed a new deal with AEW earlier this year and he recently confirmed he has no intention of leaving AEW and the length of his contract as well.</p><p>AEW did a spring cleaning of sorts not too long ago, as they had not renewed the contracts of the likes of Fuego Del Sol, Trench and <a href=#>Brian Pillman Jr</a>. This led to fans wondering if more would follow suit.</p><p>During the summer, Evil Uno announced that he had signed a new deal with All Elite Wrestling. Kip Sabian then quote-tweeted Uno’s post, <a href=#>confirming that he had also re-signed with the company</a>.</p><p>While speaking on&nbsp;<a href=#>episode #189 of Cultaholic’s Desert Island Graps</a>, Kip Sabian talked about his decision to re-sign with AEW. He confirmed that his contract is 3 years and made it clear he had no intention of leaving AEW.</p><p>”Indeed (Sabian responded when it was said AEW has him on the books for another three years). Of course, yeah (it was great news)… I love it when these things come up. I love it when these things come up because the way that now the curtain has been pulled back, there’s all this speculation and talk and this kind of stuff. I had no intentions of going anywhere else and confirmed or not, whether it was reached out to me, I wanted to stay because I genuinely love being in AEW.“</p><p>“So yeah, for me as well, it’s a pat on the back because it’s, ‘We would still like you’ so we had that conversation, we came to an agreement and I was very happy with the agreement and they were very happy with the agreement and I’m still an AEW boy. So yeah, it’s definitely the situation where there’s a lot of things I want to do over the time that I’m still in AEW so, yeah.”</p><p>Kip Sabian has been part of AEW since 2019. His most recent televised match was on the December 2nd episode of Collision, where he faced AAA Mega Champion El Hijo del Vikingo. It remains to be seen what’s next in store for the AEW star as we approach 2024.</p><p>What do you think of what Kip Sabian had to say? Are you glad he decided to stick with AEW?
