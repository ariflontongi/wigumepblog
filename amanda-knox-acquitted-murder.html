There was also no biological evidence linking Knox and Sollecito to the crime, and Knox's motivation for committing the crime was never firmly established, the judge said. DNA evidence did put Rudy Guede at the scene.</p><p dir=ltr>Referring to Knox's first 2009 conviction, the judge wrote (via The Guardian), "The international spotlight on the case in fact resulted in the investigation undergoing a sudden acceleration, that, in the frantic search for one or more guilty parties to consign to international public opinion, certainly didn't help the search for substantial truth."</p><p>Guede, who lived in a flat below Kercher, denied killing her, but also said Knox and Sollecito were not involved. At Knox and Sollecito's first acquittal trial, a witness testified that Guede confirmed their lack of involvement while in prison.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kXJvbWhlZK6urc2dmGajnqTFbq3CqqyirKSasW651Kubnqpf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-peter-pilotto.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Peter Pilotto?
