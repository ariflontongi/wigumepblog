TV. Both pacts represent a new wave of overall deals to come after last year’s writers strike.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In the post-Peak TV era of contraction, overall deals have become harder to come by and the price tag — even for prolific producers — has come down considerably. Star had signed back-to-back deals with Chris McCarthy’s MTV Entertainment Studios, with his last pact a companywide one with Paramount Global. Emily in Paris was originally developed for TV Land but was sold to Netflix after the basic cable network exited the scripted originals business. It remains the streaming giant’s top half-hour comedy. His other recent show, Netflix’s <a href=# id=auto-tag_uncoupled_1 data-tag=uncoupled>Uncoupled</a>, was canceled after one season, only for Paramount’s Showtime — now overseen by Chris McCarthy — to rescue it before eventually dropping it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Star is repped by UTA and Ziffren Brittenham.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOnZirqpWjerTAwKtknrCZqcBuvMCrmKanpaPBbsHNoq2eqqOWuW7A1WabnpmcYn5zf5RxbWprYmx8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./clarins-double-serum-light-texture-review-sale-7254007.html><span>←</span><span>Clarins' New Lightweight Serum Gives Skin a Plump Glow</span></a>
