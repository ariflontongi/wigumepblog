It already had a built-in fan base by depicting the adventures of famed real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren and the involvement of respected actors <a href=#>Patrick Wilson</a> and Vera Farmiga. Add in the ascendence of director<a href=#> James Wan </a>as a modern horror master, and you have a whole <a href=#>universe</a> of shared, interconnected films to keep raking in the box office grosses. Apparently, that money-making quality transitions over to other fields, because the original The Conjuring house has been <a href=#>sold</a> for a whopping 1.525 million.&nbsp;</p><p>To backtrack a bit, The Conjuring was inspired by the story of the Perron family, who experienced supposed paranormal activity at their Rhode Island farmhouse in 1971. The family called in Ed and Lorraine Warren, and the various happenings became the subject of horror afficianados for decades after. The real-life house owned by the Perron family has now been sold at 27% above the asking price, which is really something when you take a look at the current real estate market. Per the <a href=#>Wall Street Journal</a>, the current owners of the house, Cory and Jenn Heinzen, are themselves paranormal investigators and have used the house as their base of operations for years, which has to be pretty good advertising for their line of work.&nbsp;</p><p>Since they bought The Conjuring house in 2019, Cory and Jenn Heinzen have charged other investigators/spooky looky-lous to stay overnight and presumably experience something of what the Perron family did. However, due to a combination of business and health problems, the Heinzens have sold The Conjuring house to Boston-area real estate developer Jacqueline Nuñez. While that is a profession that in pop culture generally is in the business of tearing down community centers in order to build shopping malls, apparently Jacqueline Nuñez is actually interested in the house as a hotbed of paranormal activity.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, the Heinzens put a number of requirements into the contractual purchase of the home, one of which is that Jacqueline Nuñez could not live in The Conjuring house full time. According to the former owners, the psychic energy of the house can have negative effects on long-term residents, which is pretty much the entire premise of The Conjuring and raises some questions about how long the Heinzens themselves have lived there.&nbsp;</p><p>Reportedly, Jacqueline Nuñez is teaming up with Christine Perron (played by Joey King in the original film) to turn the house into something of a tourist attraction for interested parties to visit and to turn it into a “house of love.” We might recommend that she watch any of eight films inspired by the negative vibes of the house before thinking that is a likely possibility, but good luck to them. The Conjuring house long ago entered the realm of terrifying rumor and legend, so trying to put a positive spin on it can only be good for everyone involved.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ismJp6pLvNo6yroZ6ceqm71KycZqqZmbakwcuorKxlnaS7psWNoaumpA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./news-spotemgottem-death-rumors-swirl-rapper-shot-5-times-drive-by-incident.html><span>←</span><span>SpotemGottem death rumors swirl after rapper is shot 5 times in drive-by incident</span></a>
