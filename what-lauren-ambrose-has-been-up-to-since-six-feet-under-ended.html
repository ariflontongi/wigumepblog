Ambrose realized her dream when she made her&nbsp;<a href=#>Broadway debut in My Fair Lady</a>&nbsp;in 2018, taking on the lead role of Eliza Doolittle. Despite only sticking around for a short stint in the production,&nbsp;<a href=#>Ambrose earned a Tony nomination</a>&nbsp;for her performance.&nbsp;</p><p>She told the&nbsp;<a href=#>LA Times</a>&nbsp;the Edwardian-era plot is still relevant today, saying, "I can't imagine doing this show at any other time. It's so resonant for right now, and you can feel it in the room every time."</p><p>Considering that her role on Six Feet Under didn't require much singing, you'd be forgiven for having doubts about whether or not Ambrose could take on a singing role. But this actually wasn't the actress's first time singing her heart out.&nbsp;In fact, the&nbsp;<a href=#>Six Feet Under</a> star had already been the lead singer in her own band for a decade. Since 2009,&nbsp;Ambrose has been crooning jazz tunes&nbsp;with the Leisure Class, which she casually dismissed to the <a href=#>New Yorker</a> as a "fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants kind of thing." Her humble remark belies her versatility, which ranges from the soprano twittering of Eliza Doolittle to the sultry alto belting of Depression-era tunes like,<a href=#>"Hey, Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?"</a></p><p>It's clear that Ambrose loves to sing, but she's also lent her vocal talents to a less than sultry role.&nbsp;If you've seen the 2009 Film Where the Wild Things Are, you might have recognized Ambrose as the voice of one of the lead monsters, KW. And just before that, she added another role to her resume when she became a mom.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmam9kbH1xe9ahmK1lnJbCs7HNZpimmqKkwKZ5x5qqZpqVmrtuwc9mq6hlo567pLGMrKCxZZaasrV51KebnqpdmrulscNo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-captain-lee.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Captain Lee?</span></a>
