It has received average reception from many critics, gaining a 60 percent from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rotten Tomatoes</a>.</p><p>Surprising to many, this movie is based on a true story.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Casa Hogar?</h2><p>The real orphanage <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Casa Hogar Cabo</a> is an organization that strives to help children who are in need. On the organization’s website, they share their thoughts on the recent Netflix drama. They wrote, “Blue Miracle is an exciting, family-friendly movie loosely based on a Casa Hogar story from 2014.”</p><p>However, while the orphanage was the inspiration behind the film, they do not receive money from its success. The website goes on to optimistically state, “While there is no financial benefit to Casa Hogar for this movie, we are hopeful that Blue Miracle will raise awareness and sensitivity for private Social Assistance Centers in Mexico, most of which, like ours, operate as charities without government funding.”</p><p>Casa Hogar is active on social media and YouTube, offering information and visiting opportunities to its supporters.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Blue Miracle’s co-writer and director Julio Quintana shared his journey towards making the film, crediting Casa Hogar for its inspiration. He shared, “My first reaction was ‘this is too unbelievable to be real,’ but once I realized it was true and they won and used the money to save the orphanage, I just had to be a part of it.”</p><p>Producer Trey Reynolds added to Quintana’s thoughts, expressing, “We were attracted to the film because it had all the elements of a true underdog story, combined with sports, and a strong faith-based message. It was the kind of movie that, as a father, I would want to take my kids to see.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Casa Hogar’s thoughts on the movie</h2><p>Casa Hogar has been gaining an increasing amount of attention due to the movie’s release.

While we’ve all had our full of video calls this one was really fun providing the movie leads the opportunity to meet the current Casa Hogar residents.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-embed-handler wp-block-embed-embed-handler"></figure><p>Among its large cast, Blue Miracle stars Dennis Quaid (Soul Surfer, The Day After Tomorrow), Jimmy Gonzales (Mayans M.C.), Anthony Gonzalez (Coco), Raymond Cruz (Breaking Bad), Nathan Arenas (Diary of a Future President) and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Miguel Ángel García</a>.
