I don't really even know how it happened
I started talkin', they started laughin'
I don't really even know how it happened
I started watchin' them photographin'
I don't really (I don't really), how it happened
Instead of stoppin', they still were flashin' (I don't really)
I started walkin' (I don't really), gave no reaction
No reaction[Chorus]
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
