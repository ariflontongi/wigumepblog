The royal and her husband, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a25235705/who-is-princess-beatrice-boyfriend-edoardo-mapelli-mozzi/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi</a>, welcomed their first child, a daughter, over the weekend, Buckingham Palace confirmed.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a statement, the palace wrote that the couple—who married in July 2020—“are delighted to announce the safe arrival of their daughter” on September 18 at 11:42 p.m. at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Both mother and child, who weighed in at a healthy six pounds and two ounces, “are doing well.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Added a spokesperson, “The new baby’s grandparents and great-grandparents have all been informed and are delighted with the news. The family would like to thank all the staff at the hospital for their wonderful care.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">No name has been announced yet, but a palace statement said that the couple are “looking forward to introducing their daughter to her big brother Christopher Woolf,” who is Edoardo’s son from a previous relationship.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Beatrice’s parents, Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew, are said to have both left Balmoral in Scotland when their daughter was admitted to the hospital on Friday. The Duke of York had been accused of “hiding” on the queen’s holiday Scottish estate as lawyers tried to serve him with Virginia Giuffre’s sex abuse lawsuit.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Beatrice enjoyed a relatively low-key pregnancy, continuing her work right up until her September due date. Most recently, she stepped out for a visit to England’s Forget Me Not Children’s Hospice to meet families, staff, and volunteers as she highlighted their work.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“In the last 10 years, the charity has supported over 800 families—I am simply lost for words as to the difference that this support has made to so many lives,” Beatrice said in a statement. “When people ask me why I became the patron of this amazing charity, I only have to explain how much of an important part of the community Russell House and the charity has become. And how much of a momentous achievement it is for us to be stood here today celebrating 10 years of supporting that community.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Earlier this month, she also joined Richard Branson’s children Holly and Sam Branson at an event for an organization that finds and backs pioneers who lead early-stage projects that support young people. As a trustee of the Big Change charity, she remains active in a number of their activities and initiatives.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/45770d72-fac8-4474-90bb-36e121ad9a67_1543445615.jpeg alt="Headshot of Omid Scobie" title="Headshot of Omid Scobie" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Omid Scobie is <a href=#>BAZAAR.com</a>’s Royal Editor at Large and has covered the lives and philanthropic work of the younger members of the British Royal Family for over eight years.
