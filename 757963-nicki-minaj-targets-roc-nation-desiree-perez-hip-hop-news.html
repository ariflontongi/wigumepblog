Overall, it is being widely debated whether or not this tear has been a good thing. No matter the case, it is clear that she is angry. The reason <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">for her anger stems from the track "Hiss,"</a> in which she and Kenneth Petty are dissed by <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Megan Thee Stallion</a>. In fact, it seems like Meg may have also taken shots at <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Tory Lanez</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a>. Either way, Nicki is upset about all of this, and she has been taking to social media to reveal her hatred for Meg.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This morning, Nicki even <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">dropped off her diss track "Big Foot."</a> Unfortunately for Nicki, this new diss track is not getting the reaction she probably would have hoped for. Instead, people are clowning the diss track, saying that it has some of here worst bars yet. Furthermore, Safaree has begun <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">trending as some think he really did ghostwrite for her</a>. Regardless, Nicki does not care. She is making it clear that she has more gas in the tank, and is not afraid to piss more people off. In fact, in the tweet below, she revealed who her next target will be.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-nicki-minaj-picks-her-next-move>Nicki Minaj Picks Her Next Move</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Desiree Perez is the CEO of Roc Nation, and she is someone who has been name-checked by Nicki in the past. There is clearly some tension there, and Minaj may just fire off a diss track about her, very soon. "On the next song I delve into all the ppl Desiree allegedly fired for unknown reasons…other things as well," Nicki said. "So many ppl were blind sighted & hurt by her. Allegedly. She’s willing to go broke to try to replace me…? Fix it JESUS." For now, a release date for this Perez diss is unknown.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Whether or not Nicki releases this track, remains to be seen. However, she seems dead set on going after every single person who has ever wronged her. If nothing else, Nicki is showing us she still has a lot of fire.
