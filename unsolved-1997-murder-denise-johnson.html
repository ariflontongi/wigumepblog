She also told friends she felt that she was being stalked. One evening in July 1997, Johnson left her job at the Barrier Inn&nbsp;at around 11 p.m. Little is known about Johnson's final few hours. However, according to <a href=#>Crime Line</a>, after work, she was seen visiting a convenience store near Avalon Drive in the company of a young blonde woman. The identity of her companion is still unknown.</p><p dir=ltr>Sometime that night, Johnson fought off an attacker, who stabbed her multiple times in the neck. She sustained various injuries from the struggle before succumbing to her wounds, but there was no sign of rape or sexual assault. At 4:34 a.m. a neighbor called the emergency services after spotting smoke coming from Johnson's house. The police were able to collect 59 pieces of evidence from the scene, but with no obvious suspects, the case went cold for many years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9knFtcGthZMKvv86lrZ6cXWaGeoOMpqyrnJWneqWxzaKqnmWapLWvv86nZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-one-show-alex-jones-son-kit-surgery.html><span>←</span><span>The One Show's Alex Jones shares update on son Kit, 4, following surgery</span></a>
