Thankfully, things between the two are better now as Riddle has made it clear a match with Goldberg could take place in AEW in the future.</p><p>In case you didn’t know, Goldberg has been waiting for a retirement match for a while now. Goldberg also blasted Vince McMahon for denying him his retirement match and&nbsp;<a href=#>accused McMahon of making false promises about his retirement match</a>. Naturally, there are quite a few contenders for Goldberg as far as his retirement bout is concerned.</p><p>While speaking to <a href=#>Signed By Superstars</a>, Matt Riddle was asked about squaring off against Goldberg in the future. Riddle made it clear he would love to face Goldberg and noted that AEW seems like the most likely destination for the bout.</p><p>‘‘I personally would love to work with William Goldberg, he would be a great match. I think I could get something out of him that people haven’t seen in years and I think it’d be great for business. It’d be really good for me, but at the end of the day, you can’t – if he wants to do it, he’ll do it, if he needs to do it, he’ll do it. There’s a couple of places we could do that, I would imagine, you know maybe in AEW, TNA or NJPW. If it was going to happen, it would probably in AEW.”</p><p>Only time will tell whether Goldberg will ever get his retirement match as&nbsp;<a href=#>the match was not concern for WWE</a>. After all, a match between Matt Riddle and the WWE Hall of Famer would definitely be something fans want to see somewhere down the line.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What’s your opinion on what Matt Riddle had to say?
