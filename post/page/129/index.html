<a href=../../../what-is-the-purpose-of-a-coolant-bypass-valve-html.html></a>
Answer
When the engine is cold and the thermostat is closed, most engines have a small coolant bypass passage that allows a small amount of coolant to circulate within the cylinder block and head of the engine. This ensures that all of the cylinders are heated evenly and prevents hot spots. When the engine begins to warm up, the bypass must be closed or the engine will become restricted.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>What two consecutive integers does the square root of 50 lie?</h2><time>Aug 10, 2024</time>
