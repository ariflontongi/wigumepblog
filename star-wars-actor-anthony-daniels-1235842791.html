<span>Billy Koelling</span></p><h1>C-3P0 Actor Anthony Daniels Auctions Off His Memorabilia</h1></header><section class=post-content><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Anthony Daniels is parting with his head, and he’s feeling a little hesitant.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The actor, who has played the intergalactic robot C-3PO in numerous Star Wars movies and TV shows spanning over 40 years, is unloading his entire collection of Star Wars goodies in an auction thrown by memorabilia specialists Propstore that will be held next week in Los Angeles.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">One of the centerpieces of the Anthony Daniels Collection is a screen-matched light-up head that Daniels wore in 1983’s <a href=# id=auto-tag_return-jedi data-tag=return-jedi>Return of the Jedi</a>. The object, consisting of a faceplate, backplate and neck-ring, could fetch anywhere from $500,000 to $1 million. (At a similar auction involving Daniels last November, another C-3PO head gaveled for almost $850,000.)</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">C-3PO is central to Daniels’ identity as an actor, and that head is in some ways the mask he presents to the world. “It is not only the prop that I wore, but it was also a prop I would use in interviews to identify myself,” Daniels tells The Hollywood Reporter from his home in England. “It’s very much, ‘You don’t know my face, but you know this face.’”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">And a few weeks ago, he was doing a final photo shoot with the head and “had a slight wobble,” as he puts it. “Am I right to move this on?” he asked himself. “I have lived with these items for 50 years, some of them,” he notes, “and I have very mixed feelings.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">It was a fleeting feeling, his resolve rebuilding itself as quickly as some new Death Star. “I had all this stuff, almost all of it was in cupboards, drawers and in attics. Nobody was looking at it, nobody was treasuring it, if you will. And it was too good to throw away,” says the actor.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">This is the second and final batch of items being unloaded by the actor, who previously sold a stash in a Propstore auction in London in November. It’s a rare opportunity for collectors, as<strong> </strong>Daniels is the only major actor from Star Wars to openly sell his memorabilia. In 2023, items belonging to late Chewbacca actor Peter Mayhew were to have been sold off until his widow learned of the auction and asked for the items to be donated to Mayhew’s foundation.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Daniels originally was going to leave his collection to his wife, Christine Savage, to sell after he died. When he told her his plan, her response was, “Why don’t you sell it now?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“She doesn’t want to deal with this stuff,” says the actor, who turned 78 in February.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Amid the everything-must-go mentality, Daniels did keep two things. One was a statue from Lucasfilm congratulating him for 40 years of service. The other, an 18-inch C-3PO statue made out of Legos.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">But it feels like everything else droid- and Daniels-related is in the auction, from a hand-annotated early draft script from the original Star Wars movie and pages of hand-written Ewok dialogue to a C-3PO Igloo cooler and a pair of unworn R2-D2 Adidas jogging shoes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">It is evening in London, and the actor picks up the auction catalog for his objets d’art. He falls into a reflective mood as he thumbs through the pages, memories bubbling up like an X-wing rising from a swamp.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Among the items are two lots of sockets and tubes from the famed starship the Millennium Falcon, parts that Daniels rescued when he came across a bonfire transpiring in the U.K.’s Elstree Studios after completing shooting Return of the Jedi. There was less thought given to props in that era of moviemaking, and storage space always remained an issue. Besides, no one thought Star Wars would continue after the original trilogy.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“They were burning the Millennium Falcon,” he said, his voice rising in astonishment. “I was horrified. I think everyone is fond of the Falcon. It had a character about it. The wooden and the plastic and parts, they were making a disgusting bonfire in the drizzle. I just picked up some pieces.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Chairbacks, such as the ones from Returns of the Jedi and Force Awakens that are in the auction, were useless for the actor as he never used chairs while in costume on sets.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I couldn’t sit down,” he says. “I could never get out of the costume. I always thought that if the world was nuked, I’d be wandering the desert to this day.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Well, surely the C-3PO belt buckles got some use, no?</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“They were more trophies than buckles,” he remarks, adding he was never the type of actor who would self-publicize himself. Then he jumps into a mock conversation. “That’s me on the buckle.” Then in another voice, says, “Really? Who are you?” “Anthony Daniels.” “And …?” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Perhaps one of the more random items for sale is an autographed Pittsburgh Penguins hockey jersey with the number 77 (the year the original movie was released) that he received for doing a charity event for the NHL team. He even got to ride the Zamboni, which he was fine the first two times the ice resurfacing machine circled the arena for the presentation, but then had to stay on it as it went about smoothing over the ice for the entire rink.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It was a superb evening,” he recalls. “Would I ever go to a hockey match again? No.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Also up for grabs also is an Empire Strikes Back set security badge with the letters S. and W.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“You couldn’t get on the set without that. And one day Gary Kurtz, the producer, arrived on the set and he didn’t have it. And they wouldn’t let him on,” he says, before erupting in a chuckle. “Brilliant.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Elsewhere, the ginger bread cookie that is for sale may be more bitter than sweet. It was given to him on the last day of shooting 2019’s The Last Jedi by Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I passed <a href=# id=auto-tag_mark-hamill data-tag=mark-hamill>Mark Hamill</a> on his last day,” Daniels remembers, “and he said, ‘I’ve been in all these movies and what I am getting as a leaving present? A cookie.’ And I kind of laughed. And then the same thing happened to me. I got a cookie.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">How did you feel when you got the cookie?</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“How did you think I felt?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Why did you decide to not eat the cookie and instead keep it?</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Well, it was my leaving present. Would you eat your leaving present?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Propstore’s entertainment memorabilia auction runs March 12-14, with the Anthony Daniels Collection hitting March 13.
