What we had, I forgot</h2><p><strong>Karol G </strong>is the one who begins attacking her former partner <strong>Anuel AA</strong>, with whom she broke up back in March 2022. When Shakira's turn comes, she gets off to a strong start.</p><p>"Seeing you with the new one hurt me, but I'm already on my own, what we lived is forgotten and that's what has offended you," <strong>Shakira </strong>sings.</p><p>"And even my life has improved, you are no longer welcome here, what your girlfriend threw at me, that doesn't even make me angry, I laugh".</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>2. You want to come back</h2><p>As soon as <strong>Shakira </strong>appears, her attacks are reminiscent of those she had already launched in previous songs. <strong>Pique </strong>and <strong>Chia </strong>are her targets again and she does not hide it.</p><p>"Now you want to come back, you can tell, (mmm yeah), wait for me there, as if I'm an idiot," she adds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/e00-marca.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2023/02/24/16772190341829.jpg><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>3. Errors I don't repeat</h2><p>Then, there is another reference to what is already expressed in the previous verse, implying that <strong>Pique </strong>would have hinted that he wanted to go back to her. However, <strong>Shakira </strong>stresses that she won't "repeat the same error".</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>4. "Harder"</h2><p>Many of the lyrics are reminiscent, in fact, to some in her song Music Sessions #53.</p><p>"You left and I got triple M: better, harder, more level," she claims.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>5. Like</h2><p>Although she sings this along with <strong>Karol G, </strong>one of the most striking phrases comes when <strong>Shakira </strong>speculates that <strong>Pique </strong>would have tried to show some kind of rapprochement.</p><p>"And you want to come back, I already guessed it when you liked a picture of me," she sings.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/e00-marca.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2023/02/24/16772233921922.jpg><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>6. Remembering 'Monotonia'.</h2><p>In another verse, <strong>Shakira </strong>makes a reference to last year's hit, 'Monotonia'.</p><p>"Looking for food somewhere else, saying it was monotony and now you want to go back, I thought so when you liked my photos," sings the Colombian.</p><h2 class=ue-c-article__subheadline>7. I don't compete for men</h2><p><strong>Shakira </strong>does not forget to refer to <strong>Pique</strong>'s partner in her new song, asking the former <strong>Barcelona </strong>centre-back to "tell your new baby that I don't compete for men".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6mrKyhk2R%2FcX6SaGdrZ2JpfHd%2FxXGZbmhpZ4N5sZKenZ1uYW2vdYHEb2WhrJ2h</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sakamoto-days-chapter-146.html><span>←</span><span>Sakamoto Days Chapter 146 Spoiler, Release date, Recap, Raw Scan, Where to Read &amp;amp; Everything We Know</span></a>
