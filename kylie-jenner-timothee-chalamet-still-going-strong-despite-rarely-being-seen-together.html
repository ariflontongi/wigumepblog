They have been together for over a year, and seem to still be doing well.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/kylie-jenner-protective-of-timothee-chalamet-relationship-source-exclusive-8673134 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none><u>People</u></a>, Jenner is “protective” of their relationship but, when she does speak of her boyfriend—whom she has been with since spring 2023—she talks about him with “a huge smile,” a source told the outlet. (Cue the awwws.)&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XRNwMFNZPkBVUNYnW64Tvh-1920-80.jpg><p>Despite rarely being seen in public together, the two “are still going strong,” People writes. Even though they live on different coasts—Jenner in L.A., and Chalamet in New York City—they are adamant about spending time together, and Jenner “really likes so many things about him,” a source said of Chalamet.</p><p>They added that “Things are great with Timothée. Kylie is happy. They are both busy, but making time to see each other, especially on the weekends. He’s been working in NYC. She’s visited him, and he’s also been back to L.A. some weekends. They’re making it work.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xhu7pkKPpEe8hKxDfC4V8B-1920-80.jpg><p>The source told People that Jenner very much doesn’t want her relationship in the public eye, but she’s smitten. After buzz started circulating in spring 2023, the two hard launched their relationship at Beyoncé’s Renaissance World Tour in September 2023; they then kept their public-facing streak going at New York Fashion Week and the U.S. Open, during which time a source told People that the couple’s relationship was “fun and uncomplicated.”</p><p>At the time, a source said “They have been seeing each other for six months now [which—quick calculation—would make the beginning of their relationship roughly March 2023]. He makes Kylie happy. He has his own life and understands that Kylie needs to prioritize her kids.” (Jenner shares daughter Stormi and son Aire with ex Travis Scott.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LC4rk64b5A9uaNX2w4z34h-1920-80.jpg><p>In January, Jenner and Chalamet sat next to one another at <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/golden-globes/>the Golden Globes</a>—and even got caught sharing a kiss on camera. But, then, silence—no photographs together for five months, until recently, anyway. Photographers “caught the couple walking into the TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood,” People reports, and the world heaved a big sigh of relief, knowing that this couple was, in fact, still very much a couple.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
