During the interview with <a href=#>Archive of American Television</a>, O'Neill called out Amanda Bearse, who is lesbian, for growing more "masculine" over the years. He also admitted that he thought the idea of two women getting married in tuxedos was funny, but he felt offended when Bearse didn't invite him to her wedding. For her part, Bearse called out the sitcom for being "misogynistic."</p><p dir=ltr>"It was a mean-spirited and misogynist show," Bearse told <a href=#>News Corp Australia</a>&nbsp;in 2018.&nbsp;"It was just so completely inappropriate. Today I don't think the show would be produced because it's so globally offensive." According to O'Neill, he once threatened to get Bearse fired after a particularly volatile argument because he was the star of the show. Bearse wasn't the only actor who felt that way. Katey Sagal, who played Peggy on the show, believed that the sitcom featured a negative portrayal of women.</p><p>"It was a very misogynistic show," Sagal told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>&nbsp;in 2017. "It was when I really, clearly understood that my job as an actor was to interpret the material. It's not necessarily my belief system. My belief system has nothing to do with being an actor."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcW5laoJ3e9OhnGasp6R6rq3Rq6CenF2strW0jJyfoqSUp7KvedKtmKurXam1osCMnaCdpqRitKbAjJqjqKaXYryvedKeq2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-game-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>The Game Net Worth 2024</span></a>
