It has three large camera lenses that dominate its top left corner. At first, this may seem very intimidating. You can rest easy knowing that its IP68 rating is great when it comes to water resistance. It has the capabilities of withstanding being submerged in liquid for up to a height of 4 meters for half an hour.</p><p class=align-left>The phone weighs 6.63 ounces and is also slightly wider and thicker than its predecessors. This could be because of the battery enhancements. The device has a notch at the front which houses the TrueDepth camera system, its front speakers, as well as other sensors.</p><p class=align-left>One other conspicuous thing about this gadget is the fact that it<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> comes without </a>a Home button, a bottom bezel, and it also lacks a Touch ID fingerprint sensor. The Face ID is enough for the necessary biometric authentications that may be needed.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/53938ccaf107c7ba.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>iPhone 7 Plus review: A reliable handset with amazing features</span></p></a><p class=align-left>On the left is the standard mute switch as well as volume buttons. Its right side features a side button which also doubles up as a power button. The back also has a large square-shaped camera bump which houses three lenses that are arranged in a triangle shape. There is also the flash and microphone next to it.</p><h3>Display</h3><p class=align-left>It comes with a 5.8-inch Super Retina XDR display. It has a full-screen OLED display that stretches from one edge to the other and from top to bottom with minimal bezels. One of the first things you will note about the display is that it comes in fairly conservative hues including Space Gray, Silver, Gold, and Midnight Green.</p><p class=align-left>You may also like the fact that it resists fingerprint marks with its matte finish at the back. It is also less slippery compared to other glass phones. The Super Retina display features vivid, true-to-life colours that have deeper blacks. The new contrast ratio is 2,000,000:1, up from 1,000,000:1</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1c8ad7670727315c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>iPhone 11 review: The elegant smartphone you should buy</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The material is also quite resistant as it is made of Gorilla glass. While it may crack when dropped from shoulder length, it is still better than most phones. In case you are worried about scratches and smudges, it would be a good idea to invest in a screen protector.</p><h3>Processor, storage & performance</h3><p class=align-left>One of the most important aspects of any smartphone is its performance and capabilities. It uses the A13 Bionic chip. The processor offers 20% faster CPU, GPU and machine-learning performance even in real-world tests.</p><p class=align-left>When the overall performance was measured, the iPhone 11 Pro scored 1,337 when measured on the single-core. It also registered a score of 3,509 when a multicore test was done. These are impressive results, to say the least. Further testing on graphics led to a score of 2,174 frames or 33.8 fps on the Aztec Ruins (High Tier) off-screen benchmark. When the 3DMark Slingshot Extreme test was also done, the iPhone 11 Pro notched 6,163.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ce1ce796769e3e8a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>iPhone XR review: A reliable smartphone with amazing features</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Gamers would love to know that the A13 chip features a next-generation 8-core Neural Engine, which according to Apple, is faster than ever for real-time photo and video analysis. The pair of Machine Learning Accelerators allow the CPU to run up to six times faster, delivering more than 1 trillion operations per second. This means they can enjoy gaming uninterrupted.</p><p class=align-left>The iPhone 11 Pro memory may be a bummer for many users. The 64GB ROM is barely enough. The good news is that it comes with other variants and you can opt for - 256GB or 512GB storage. It comes with 4GB of RAM.</p><h3>iPhone 11 Pro battery</h3><p class=align-left>Its battery performance is good when compared to others before it. It lasted an average of 10 hours and 24 minutes when used to surf the web over 4G LTE on 150 nits of screen brightness. It comes bundled with a fast charger.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d9db717161a4feaf.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting facts about the iPhone 8</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The iPhone 11 Pro ships with an 18-watt charger that gets your phone to 55% in just 30 minutes. Comparatively, this is great. The Note 10's 25-watt charger only does 47% in 30 minutes. However, the OnePlus 7 Pro is a better performer as it gets to 60% with its 40-watt charger in 30 minutes.</p><h3>Speaker & call quality</h3><p class=align-left>The sound that comes from the iPhone 11 Pro compelling. This is attributed to the spatial audio and Dolby Atmos. You do not have to worry about loudness or clarity with this gadget.</p><h2>Software</h2><p class=align-left>Every great smartphone comes with excellent software features. Here are some of the few you need to look forward to.</p><h3>OS & features</h3><p class=align-left>The device ships with the iOS 13 operating system. It also comes with Siri, Face ID (through the TrueDepth camera), Apple Pay, and supports Apple Card.</p><p class=align-left>Its lock screen is also simple and has a shortcut to the camera and flashlight. The device no longer sports a 3D touch and in its place, uses Haptic Touch. Navigation gestures have been maintained.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/43c01db4b1b12cf6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting details about Samsung Galaxy A7: Price, specs, features</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You will love the newly introduced system-wide Dark Mode which can be enabled in the display settings. You will also love the new Photos app that offers a new editing mode which is more powerful and very easy to use.</p><h3>iPhone 11 Pro camera, video and image quality</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1ec53de089eeb4ee.jpg><p class=align-left>The device is among the first iPhones to sport the triple-lens camera. All the cameras are 12 megapixels with all the notable differences between them being as follows.</p><h4>Ultra wide-angle camera</h4><p class=align-left>The ultra-wide-angle camera is the rightmost lens.</p><ul><li>12-megapixel sensor</li><li>13mm focal length</li><li>f/2.4 aperture</li><li>5-element lens</li><li>120-degree field of view</li></ul><h4>Wide-angle camera</h4><p class=align-left>The wide-angle camera is located at the top left of the iPhone</p><ul><li>A larger 12-megapixel sensor that lets in more light</li><li>f/1.8 aperture</li><li>6-element lens</li><li>Optical Image Stabilization</li><li>100 per cent focus pixels</li></ul><h4>Telephoto camera</h4><p class=align-left>The telephoto camera is the bottom left lens on the iPhone</p><ul><li>12-megapixel sensor</li><li>f/2.0 aperture</li><li>6-element lens</li><li>Optical Image Stabilization</li><li>2x zoom</li><li>40% more light capture than in XS</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/561d8922a1e334c4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All the top details about LG Q70: Specs, review, release date, price</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Apple believes that the new ultra-wide-angle lens allows iPhone users to capture up to four times more scene. This said to be ideal for landscape shots, architecture shots, group portraits, among others. It is believed to give your photos an artful perspective when taking a close up shot.</p><p class=align-left>One of the best features is the Night Mode. The wide-angle camera in the iPhone 11 Pro comes with a larger sensor that gives 100 per cent Focus Pixels to allow for new low light capabilities. These include the Night Mode that is designed to brighten pictures in low lighting conditions. It is similar to what you have on Google's Night Shift mode, where photos are lightened up using complex AI software.</p><h2>iPhone 11 Pro review</h2><p class=align-left>At this point, one can almost decide whether or not they will be purchasing the smartphone. However, it is always a good idea to look into what other people have been saying about it in general. Here are a few of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">comments from YouTube</a> that we found useful.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9f235f99889a6f5c.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro: discover its specs, price, and reviews</span></p></a><ul><li><i>V Deng: design: barely, Display: slight upgrade, battery life: major, hotel: trivago</i></li><li><i>Phantomdirt: "Let's be honest; Glass is glass." - As a technical estimator for specialist glass, I hate you.
