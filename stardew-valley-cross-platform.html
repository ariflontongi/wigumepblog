Put simply, cross platform gaming allows for players to join forces even if they are playing a game on different consoles. Yup, long gone are the days when it was impossible to play a game with someone else if they were on a different console to you - and now PC, Mac, Xbox, PlayStation and Xbox players can team up or be pitted against one another.</p><p><h6 class="mb-xs text-left heading-6">More like this</h6></p><p>But does Stardew Valley allow for cross platform play? Well, put simply, no.</p><p>There is just one exception - Mac and PC players can play together, but that's currently the only option (and even then it's a bit of a stretch to call that cross platform).</p><p class="newsletter-sign-up__disclaimer body-copy-small">By entering your details, you are agreeing to our <a class="link link--styled" href=# data-component=Link>terms and conditions</a> and <a class="link link--styled" href=# data-component=Link>privacy policy</a>.
