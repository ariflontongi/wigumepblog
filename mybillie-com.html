It’s great to know that you can save up to 10% off selected bundles by purchasing them together instead of ordering your products separately.&nbsp;</p><li>Choose your Billie promo code from the Marie Claire website.</li><li>Click ‘Get Coupon’ or ‘Get Deal’ to see your promo code.</li><li>Next, click ‘Get Offer at Billie’ to go to their website.</li><li>Add your favorite bodycare products to your cart.</li><li>Click ‘Checkout’ on the pop-up menu to go to your cart.</li><li>Select ‘Gift Card or promo code’ to see the promo code box.</li><li>Copy and paste your Billie promo code into the box.</li><li>Click ‘Apply’ to add your code to your order.</li><h2 id=how-we-source-our-codes-xa0-3>How We Source Our Codes&nbsp;</h2><p>At Marie Claire, we have a dedicated team of deal experts, commercial colleagues, and editors who find and negotiate the best promo codes and coupons, as well as produce content aiming to help you shop affordably.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a dedicated team of 3 deal experts that are constantly sourcing and testing coupons and promo codes for some of the biggest retailers in fashion, beauty, and beyond to list on our website.
