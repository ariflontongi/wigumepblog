A man who lived a very complicated life. The movie will get into all of it,” King said, alluding to the multiple scandals Jackson faced.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The trailer began with a look at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/michael-jackson-biopic-cast-jackson-5-1235837660/>the Jackson 5 </a>performing “ABC” on TV, and then cut to a 1990s-era concert of Jackson performing “Man in the Mirror.” There are also images of a masked Jackson being hounded by fans and paparazzi. Jackson’s real-life nephew <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/michael-jackson-biopic-first-look-nephew-jaafar-jackson-1235793528/>Jaafar Jackson stars as Michael</a>, and in the trailer has a strong resemblance to his uncle and appears to have captured his dancing and stage presence.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“You never were like anyone else,” Jackson’s mother (portrayed in the biopic by Nia Long) says at one point in the trailer, which sells the film as going beyond the controversy to reveal the man.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Antoine Fuqua directs Michael, which is made in cooperation with Jackson’s estate, calling into question how deeply it will tackle allegations of abuse. But King said Wednesday there is an expectation to be objective in a biopic.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“When you mention his name, everyone has an opinion,” said King. “For the first time … generations of moviegoers will come together to experience an inside look at the most prolific artist who ever lived.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The feature has an April 18, 2025, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/michael-jackson-biopic-release-date-1235786009/>release date</a>.

The trailer was not released outside the room and comes amid the halfway point in production on the film. Said King: “We are incredibly proud of this movie. I’m looking forward to giving to the audience a film like they’ve never seen before.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofK61wqGYnqRdn66kt9KopWaamaS9qq%2BMn6Crq6RiubC7ymaaoqaVoq6ku81maGtrZW2Ecn2YamY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./messages-from-an-ancient-era-stone-tablets-locations-ancient-hyrulean.html><span>←</span><span>Messages from an Ancient Era stone tablet locations in Zelda: TOTK</span></a>
