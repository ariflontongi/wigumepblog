When Princess Eugenie married Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle on 12 October 2018, she, like another very famous recent royal bride, surprised everyone with her choice of designer. Although many expected her to wear Erdem or Vivienne Westwood, both being British labels that she had been photographed in before, the royal instead opted for the lesser-known London Fashion Week favourite, Peter Pilotto.
The label – which is headed up by Peter Pilotto and Christopher de Vos – was founded in 2007 and is known for its signature prints and elegant, structured shapes."><meta name=author content="Billy Koelling"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Although it might a less high-profile label than some of the brands that she was expected to wear are, that could all be about to change for the designer duo.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Here, we round up everything you need to know about the British brand.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">Two designers, not one, head up the label</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite the brand being named after Peter Pilotto, the label is actually headed up by two designers, not one.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The reason for this unusual decision is that the label was launched initially by Pilotto alone, but it wasn't long before de Vos joined him at the brand. They had planned to change the name when he joined, Pilotto said, but it just never happened.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It just didn't work," Pilotto told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/designers-dish-creative-geniuses-behind-787346 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Hollywood Reporter" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2015.

While Meghan chose a French fashion house fronted by a British woman to create her wedding gown, Eugenie opted for a British house that is fronted by two non-Brits.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Pilotto is Austrian-Italian, while his partner de Vos hails from Belgium and Peru. The two designers actually met while studying at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, Belgium, but chose to start their label in London.</p><img alt="Peter Pilotto spring/summer 2013" title="Peter Pilotto spring/summer 2013" width=4000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/peter-pilotto-ss13-1539357755.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Antonio de Moraes Barros Filho</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Peter Pilotto spring/summer 2013</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">They launched the label in 2007</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After studying together and being in a romantic relationship for a number of years, Pilotto and de Vos eventually decided to set up a label together, but the latter needed a little convincing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The duo decided to take slightly different paths when they graduated. Pilotto was getting a lot of interest in his graduate collections, while de Vos wanted to get some experience in the industry and ended up landing a job in London working for Vivienne Westwood. However, after setting up the brand alone, Pilotto managed to convince de Vos to come and join him at the label.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was like, 'So let’s do this together now,'" Pilotto told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.manrepeller.com/2016/06/peter-pilotto-and-christopher-de-vos.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Man Repeller" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Man Repeller</a>.

It was an instant hit with critics, meaning that they received start-up support and studio space from the Centre for Fashion Enterprise in London. As well as this, they gained much-needed exposure after being featured in the Vauxhall Fashion Scout showcase. They then received the Swarovski Emerging Talent Award in 2010.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">From here, the label went from strength to strength.</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">The brand is known for its prints</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Peter Pilotto is most famous for its punchy prints, which are created digitally, a process which was first developed in the '90s and refined in the '00s so that designers could easily print patterns onto luxury fabrics.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although a focus on digital printing wasn't necessarily the aim when they started designing, it became clear in Pilotto's graduate collection that this was what the focus of his future company would be.<br></p><img alt="Peter Pilotto spring/summer 2019" title="Peter Pilotto spring/summer 2019" width=2000 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/peter-pilotto-catwalk-1539357848.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Estrop</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span><p>Peter Pilotto spring/summer 2019</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It was never, during our studies, the main thing," Pilotto told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/peter-pilotto-the-princes-of-print-9765639.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Independent" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Independent</a> in an interview in 2014.
