On the show, Ye, in true fashion, let out more than a couple of bombshells. Altogether, the interview was marked by a few outlandish moments and comments that only someone like Ye could be behind.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For example, he tagged Kai Cenat an industry plant for criticizing the sizing of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Yeezy</a>'s latest drop but that’s probably the least bizarre Kanye West comment in the entire The Download episode. He also labeled <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chris Brown</a> a “God,” insisted homophobic jokes have less impact today, and even declared Michelle Obama as the woman he’d have a threesome with. Overall, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the entire episode was Kanye being Kanye</a>, and the following moments are the most noteworthy.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-5-ye-comes-for-j-cole>5. Ye Comes For <a href=# class=text-word>J. Cole</a></h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Ye and J. Cole were not necessarily feuding in the past, but it’s pretty obvious that Kanye West isn’t a fan. As soon as Justin LaBoy brought up Cole’s polarizing apology to K. Dot, Ye swiftly interjected. “F*ck all that p*ssy shit!” he said. Considering Ye and Drake’s ongoing beef, it’s clear to see why the former felt that Cole going on tour with Drake was him picking sides.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, Kanye’s later comments allow us to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">trace the hostility back to 2016</a>. Specifically, back to Cole’s track “False Prophets,” which is widely believed to be about West and his mental health issues over the years. Some of Ye’s digs at Cole on the episode include: “n*gga you can’t run now,” “you can’t say UP and Cole in the same sentence,” and finally, “I don’t even listen to J. Cole.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-4-ye-s-favorite-rappers-at-the-moment>4. Ye’s Favorite Rappers At The Moment</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Kanye West also took the time out to share his love for his younger players in the rap game. When asked by Justin LaBoy who his favorite rappers are at the moment, Ye shared that the lineup keeps changing. However, he mentioned that 21 Savage and Kodak Black are doing it for him at the moment. He also mentioned the rising star Young Moose and spoke very highly of Playboi Carti and his career trajectory.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-3-kanye-vs-drake>3. Kanye Vs. Drake</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Scattered through the episode of The Download is Kanye West’s obvious disdain for all things Drake. He spoke about feeling “energized” to eliminate Drake. However, Ye said it was much more than that. “I’m tired of this n*gga fucking with me and all that shit,” he said. “It’s not just about the elimination of Drake, we’re gonna tear the head off whoever they got that they thought was in control.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-2-ye-debuts-the-like-that-remix>2. Ye Debuts The “Like That Remix”</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">One of the most important moments on Kanye West’s episode of The Download was obviously the premiere of the “Like That Remix.” The track’s opener featured a raging Ye, who declared he was backing Kendrick Lamar up in the ongoing rap beef. “You know we had to get The Hooligans up here / We gone take this p*ssy n*gga out / Yo, Dot, I got you.” As fans continue to clamor for Kendrick’s response to Drake’s disses, Ye is the latest fighter to step into the ring.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-1-vultures-2-release-date-announcement-nbsp>1. Vultures 2 Release Date Announcement&nbsp;</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Taking the cake of all the interesting Kanye West moments on The Download is the Vultures 2 release date announcement. After the overwhelming success of Vultures 1, Ye teased the second part, and fans have been hoping for the news of the second installment. Finally, Ye has an answer. When asked by Justin LaBoy about when the album would be released, Ye simply replied, “it’s coming out May 3rd.” Evidently, the fans now have something to look forward to.&nbsp;<br></p><p>About The Author</p><p>Demilade Phillips has been a Features Writer for HotNewHipHop since 2023.
