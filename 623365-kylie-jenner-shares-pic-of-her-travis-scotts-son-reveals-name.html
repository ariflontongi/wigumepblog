She captioned the post with the baby's supposed name: "AIRE."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As such, many in the comments reacted excitedly with well-wishes and admirations. For example, Jenner's stepsister Khloé commented "The king!!! Young king!!!!!" Other celebrities chimed in with their own exclamations. Olivia Pierson wrote "There he is!!!!! Those eyes I can’t deal," while Johnny Cyrus commented "HE IS SO CUTE... AIRE AND STORMI!!! icons."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, Aire's reveal to the world involves some conflicting reports. Initially, Kylie and Travis named their second child "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Wolf,</a>" though they later said they <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">changed their minds</a>. Since then, fans have been increasingly curious about what they would name their kid.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Unfortunately, the name reveal coincided with the couple's public breakup. Us Weekly reported on the story with some unnamed sources, and many in the media world followed suit.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“Kylie and Travis are off again, they were supposed to spend the holidays together, but she went to Aspen to be with her family and friends up there,” a source stated. “This has happened so many times before, they’re known to be on again off again, but always remain friends and great co-parents.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, the "SICKO MODE" rapper recently went out on the town <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">for the first time since his split</a> from the reality TV star. Moreover, the Houston artist landed down in Los Angeles on Sunday, January 8th. What's more is that much of the reported reasoning around the split could be related to them not spending Christmas together.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Still, what do you think of Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott's son's new name, Aire?

Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output.

Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmZ4B0gpRmorKkmZp6q7HNp5yrZaOdrrOx0manoptdpLNutMSrZK2qkau2tHnSnKatrKNiwLC6jKucr52RocBuusCmnA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-princess-jasmine-makeover.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian gets a Princess Jasmine makeover but North isn't convinced</span></a>
