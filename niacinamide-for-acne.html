It’s the star of skincare marketing campaigns and tossed in just about every pore shrinking, acne fighting product and <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/g35888853/acne-spot-treatment/>spot treatment</a> under the sun. “<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a37673230/niacinamide-benefits/>Niacinamide</a> is popular for a few reasons. It can decrease inflammation in many skin conditions like acne, rosacea, and post-inflammatory discoloration; it has mechanisms to reduce unwanted pigmentation; and has shown benefit in reducing oiliness for those that have more oily skin,” explains board-certified dermatologist <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.dermatologyboise.com/physicians-and-staff/dr-dustin-portela referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Dr. Dustin Portela</a>, aka <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.tiktok.com/@drdustinportela?lang=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>@208skindoc</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While the benefits are hard to ignore, is niacinamide *really* the one-and-done solve to treating acne? The answer is a little complicated. The ingredient is so extremely versatile and 100 percent worthwhile, but it’s not a magic pimple healer when functioning solo—it needs a good team (read: <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a35588842/benzoyl-peroxide-vs-salicylic-acid/>salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide,</a> and retinoids) to provide maximum benefit. To learn exactly how niacinamide can *actually* help acne-prone skin and shop the best niacinamide skincare products, keep reading.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-are-the-benefits-of-niacinamide><span>What Are the Benefits of Niacinamide?</span></h2><p>We love a multi-purpose ingredient—and niacinamide is the epitome of a hustler. It addresses a range of concerns, from a weakened skin barrier to excess inflammation, which makes it useful in addressing multiple types of pimples and preventing future ones from popping up.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-calms-inflammation><span>Calms Inflammation</span></h3><p>Whether you find that your pimples are inflammatory in nature (think: juicy red pimples and cysts) or you have an inflammatory condition like rosacea, niacinamide can swoop in and provide a little relief. “It can help to reduce a number of inflammatory cytokines (i.e. chemicals) in the skin that can lead to increased redness and inflammation,” explains Dr. Portela. “Much of the acne that we see and feel is actually our body’s inflammatory response to the acne. When we decrease that inflammation, we can see less acne.”&nbsp;</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-strengthens-the-skin-barrier><span>Strengthens the Skin Barrier</span></h3><p>“When our skin barrier is compromised, we may notice that our sebum production (think: oil) is unregulated,” says Dr. Portela. When you have more oil, you’re *typically* more prone to get clogged pores, blackheads, and other <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/types-of-acne/>types of acne</a>. Enter: Niacinamide. “It can help strengthen our skin moisture barrier, which can send a feedback signal to regulate sebum production to more normal levels."</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-regulates-oil><span>Regulates Oil</span></h3><p>Niacinamide decreases oil on the skin’s surface, which makes it ideal for anyone with a little extra shine or congestion. “Oil provides fuel to the acne-causing bacteria,” says Dr. Portela. “Less of the oil can mean less acne.”</p><h3 class=article-body__section id=section-helps-with-hyperpigmentation><span>Helps With Hyperpigmentation</span></h3><p>Niacinamide doesn't just help regulate acne and then say peace out—it’s an ingredient that guides you through the healing process too and can reduce the appearance of post-inflammatory <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/news/a25791/how-to-get-ride-of-dark-spots/>hyperpigmentation</a>, a.k.a. the mark left behind from a pimple. “It seems to decrease the amount of pigment that is deposited into skin cells by inhibiting a process called melanosome transfer, which is when a pigment-producing cell (the melanocyte) produces pigment and literally transfers that pigment into the neighboring skin cells” explains Dr. Portela.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-will-niacinamide-help-my-acne><span>Will Niacinamide Help My Acne?</span></h2><p>As seen above, the benefits are numerous and undeniable. But let it be known that when used solo, niacinamide is not the most potent ingredient to treat acne. “It helps to modulate inflammation and slightly reduce oil production, but doesn’t directly kill acne causing bacteria or have the ability to exfoliate in the way that retinol does,” explains Dr. Portela. “Niacinamide is helpful in mild cases of acne, however in moderate and severe cases, additional therapies are needed.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-should-i-use-niacinamide><span>Should I Use Niacinamide?</span></h2><p>“Anyone can benefit from niacinamide due to its wide range of benefits,” says Dr. Portela. That said, it’s best suited for people with normal or oily skin. Anyone with dry or sensitive skin might experience a bit of irritation from the ingredient. “It can be felt as mild burning, stinging, or irritation.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-to-look-for><span>What to Look For</span></h2><p><strong>Concentration&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Over the counter products can use niacinamide in a range of concentrations, from barely there (think: 0.01 percent) to very high (think: 20 percent). But in order to see an actual benefit from the ingredient, Dr. Portela tells patients to seek out a product with a two to 10 percent concentration. “You’ll see the added benefits without risking much irritation,” he adds.</p><p><strong>Additional Ingredients&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Because niacinamide shouldn’t be the only treatment ingredient used to fight acne, you’re best off looking for a product(s) that combines niacinamide with other actives. “I like combination products that include niacinamide for its added benefits,” explains Dr. Portela. “It can be a compliment to traditional acne fighting ingredients like salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, or <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a22777936/what-is-retinol/>retinol</a>.” &nbsp;</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-the-best-niacinamide-products-for-acne><span>The Best Niacinamide Products for Acne</span></h2><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oVW32oARLGy5RRedHuurLQ-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">The Best Drugstore Niacinamide Product</span></p><p>La Roche-Posay Retinol Serum B3</p><p>This little drugstore bottle made its way to the top of Dr. Portela’s picks in large part because of its affordable price and combination therapy. “It contains gentle retinol as well as niacinamide,” he points out. As a result, it’s going to offer a resurfacing and exfoliation benefit that can help prevent acne—and provide anti-aging benefits. “At around $40, it’s a great value from a reputable company.” (Application note: Because retinol is a star in this formula, use it exclusively at night and make sure to wear SPF in the morning.)</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Dermatologist-approved; Affordable; Contains retinol&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Fragrant</p><a href=# data-model-name="CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum " data-url=The%20Best%20Niacinamide%20Serum%20With%20Retinol%20 data-hl-processed=none readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/no3eLU54YvtWMQ47DkXGAQ-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">The Best Niacinamide Serum With Retinol</span></p></a><p>CeraVe Resurfacing Retinol Serum</p><p>“CeraVe’s serum contains encapsulated retinol to help reduce irritation, while delivering results for the beginner retinol user,” explains Dr. Portela. “Paired with hyaluronic acid, ceramides, and niacinamide, you will get a boost of ingredients that help repair the skin moisture barrier.” Essentially, the fragrance-free serum has a nice balance of powerful and calming ingredients, which makes it ideal for those who have sensitive or drier skin types.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Dermatologist-recommended; Affordable; Contains retinol and hyaluronic acid</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Some report a bad smell&nbsp;</p><a href=# data-model-name="Paula’s Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster" data-url="https://www.sephora.com/product/paulas-choice-10-niacinamide-booster-P480628?country_switch=us&lang=en&skuId=2549343&om_mmc=ppc-GG_18532081096_140015651217_pla-1817965592538_2549343_626820665498_9067609_c&gclid=CjwKCAiA5sieBhBnEiwAR9oh2nojutaRIhEkvlCPpNPwPpfrWW91hcZ2B9e1qSeNkgrgPJxoLQ3NLxoCHDsQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://shop-links.co/link?country_switch=us&lang=en&skuId=2549343&om_mmc=ppc-GG_18532081096_140015651217_pla-1817965592538_2549343_626820665498_9067609_c&gclid=CjwKCAiA5sieBhBnEiwAR9oh2nojutaRIhEkvlCPpNPwPpfrWW91hcZ2B9e1qSeNkgrgPJxoLQ3NLxoCHDsQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=hawk-custom-tracking&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fpaulas-choice-10-niacinamide-booster-P480628%3Fcountry_switch%3Dus%26lang%3Den%26skuId%3D2549343%26om_mmc%3Dppc-GG_18532081096_140015651217_pla-1817965592538_2549343_626820665498_9067609_c%26gclid%3DCjwKCAiA5sieBhBnEiwAR9oh2nojutaRIhEkvlCPpNPwPpfrWW91hcZ2B9e1qSeNkgrgPJxoLQ3NLxoCHDsQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&article_name=hawk-article-name&article_url=hawk-article-url" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=sephora.com data-merchant-id=204077 data-merchant-url=sephora.com data-merchant-network=Generic readability=1><p class=vanilla-image-block data-bordeaux-image-check><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/afpvr49vDWfQT9vJHtXgdQ-1920-80.png><span class="featured__label horizontal__label">The Most Powerful Niacinamide Product</span></p></a><p>Paula’s Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster</p><p>“This is a dedicated 10% niacinamide serum with a lightweight feel,” says Dr. Portela. “It’s easy to combine with other skin care products in your routine.” That said, because it’s so multitasking you’ll probably find that you can cut out a lot of excess.
