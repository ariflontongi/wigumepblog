They said, ‘Since we eat food, this one too’! Please 1 Corinthians 7:5, let’s close! All the married people read this Scripture! That you break with food doesn’t mean you should break with everything!“Twenty-one days ‘no go kill you!’ Stay away from that area! Life is not about $ex. This is not the time to sleep with your husband and wife! Can you hear what I’m saying? From tomorrow, close that place till twenty-one days!“...You know people, when it comes to bad things they preach the Bible! They won’t read! They say, ‘Since we break with food, why don’t we break for the other one?’ When we break finish’, we will continue the fasting! ‘Na lie!’ It’s not so oh.”<h2>2023: Peter Obi meets Ibiyeomie, releases message, photos</h2><p class=align-left><a href=#>Peter Obi</a>, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), has disclosed how blessed and enriched he was to have <a href=#>met Pastor David Ibiyeomie</a> of Salvation Ministry in Port Harcourt, Rivers recently.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d348c9832aa0d3f8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Wike to back Atiku?
