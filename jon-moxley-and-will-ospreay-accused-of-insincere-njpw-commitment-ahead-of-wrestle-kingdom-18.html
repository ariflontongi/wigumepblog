This new championship is set to replace the now-defunct IWGP United States/United Kingdom Heavyweight Championship.</p><p>The company even&nbsp;<a href=#>introduced the new IWGP Global Heavyweight Championship</a>&nbsp;during the official Wrestle Kingdom 18 press conference. It is also to be noted that most fans have completely overlooked David Finlay in the upcoming match, dismissing him as a nobody.</p><p>While speaking <a href=#>with Sports Illustrated for new interview</a>, David Finlay criticized Moxley and Ospreay for pretending to love Japan but ultimately leaving NJPW in a short period of time anyway.</p><p>”I’ve been a constant for the past nine years. Mox is coming for a cup of coffee. Ospreay is leaving soon [to wrestle for AEW]. They say they love Japan and they say it’s so hard to leave, then they dry their tears with first-class tickets home.”</p><p>Will Ospreay also <a href=#>decided to extend an olive branch to Jon Moxley</a> for their Wrestle Kingdom 18 bout. Only time will tell who will come out on top in the highly-anticipated matchup.</p><p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<a href=#>Ringside News</a>&nbsp;will be providing live play-by-play coverage of the event over in our&nbsp;<a href=#>Wrestle Kingdom</a>&nbsp;hub. Coverage of the event will kick off at 1:30 AM ET. Keep checking back for any late breaking news, rumors and spoilers heading into the show.</p><p>What do you make of what David Finlay had to say?
