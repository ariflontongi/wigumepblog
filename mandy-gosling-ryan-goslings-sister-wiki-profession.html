Her father, who was a traveling salesman for a paper factory, moved to different cities together with her little brother while she was growing up.&nbsp;Some of the cities she lived in include Ontario, Burlington in Ontario, and Cornwall.</span></p><p><span>Gosling’s parents divorced when his brother was just 13 his age.&nbsp;This difficult situation made Mandi even more responsible for her brother.&nbsp;Even Ryan would admit, Mandi and her mother really helped structure her life and made her ‘think like a girl’.&nbsp;She is also a loving aunt to her brother’s two daughters, who she had with her longtime partner, Eva Mendes.</span></p><p><strong><span>Subtitle:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Mandi Gosling with her mother and brother</span></p><p><strong><span>Source</span></strong><span>&nbsp;:&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer"><span>www.indy100.com</span></a></p><h2><strong><span>Mandi Gosling’s Education</span></strong></h2><p><span>Mandi Gosling studied at California State University Northbridge and graduated with a degree in journalism and political science in 2011. She appears to be quite ahead in her studies as it is believed that she received the Judge Julian Beck Award as the most outstanding graduate.&nbsp;Perhaps this is one of the reasons why Ryan sees her older sister as a great influencer.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Mandi Gosling’s career</span></strong></h2><p><span>Unlike her younger brother, there is very little information about the beautiful Lady Gosling.&nbsp;It is almost impossible to know about her private life, her relationships or her hobbies while she is not active on social media.&nbsp;She sometimes shares her video of her solo performances on YouTube.&nbsp;Online news confirmed that she works as a producer on Dateline, thanks to her previous knowledge of her in theater.</span></p><p><span>Click here to read about Laurel Coppock.</span></p><p><span>.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3>Advertisement <a class=close-stky-ads onclick='if(!window.__cfRLUnblockHandlers)return!1;document.getElementById("bl_banner").style.display="none"' data-cf-modified-2928f253abd628ee3d207dfa- href=#></a><p>Copyright © 2024.
