Wallace, tensions&nbsp;continued to rise between coastal emcees.&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Hip hop was birthed out of New York and for years the tri-state area</a> was championed, however, West Coast artists began making a name for themselves with the rise of&nbsp;rappers like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>N.W.A.</a> and Ice Cube. It was believed that the deaths of Pac and Biggie would cause hip hop to unite for the good of peace, but artists, as well as fans, remained divided.</p><p>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"You know, everybody was getting&nbsp;caught up in the moment," Cube said. "We were gettin' into our feelings. I was kind cocked and loaded but then the minister was speaking to us. He told us the story of the Nation and Malcolm X. When the Nation and Malcolm X was apart, it just gave room for somebody to swoop in and take Malcolm, and it all fell in the lap of the Nation 'cause they was beefing in public, so it gives the opportunity for somebody on the side."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Tupac wasn't killed by Biggie, and Biggie wasn't killed by Tupac," Cube continued. "These are all side people stepping in. History starts to rehash it. 'Biggie killed Tupac.' The East Coast-West Coast beef caused Tupac and Biggie to be killed." Cube went on to say that everyone decided to "squash the beef," and he recognized that he was the one to take things too far.
