It was just like… it was a real whirlwind."&nbsp;The couple undertook five engagements in five days. Meghan revealed, "Until that last week in the UK, I rarely wore colour." The reason for that she explains was because, "I never wanted to upstage, or ruffle any feathers. So I just tried to blend in."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8abb3e9748b6-megz12-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eGq2vgjbYByu data-wc=10><strong>Meghan has a fitting in her green Emilia Wickstead dress</strong></p><p id=eW_QLY5AhELl data-wc=43>Then she continues, “But I wore a lot of colour that week… I just felt like, ‘Let’s just look like a rainbow.’” Harry elaborates that "We weren’t with the family.

She continues, “To my understanding, you could never wear the same colour as Her Majesty if there's a group event, but then you also shouldn't be wearing the same colour as one of the other more senior members of the family. So I was like, 'Well, what's a colour that they'll probably never wear?' Camel, beige, white... so I wore a lot of muted tones, but it was also so I could just blend in. I'm not trying to stand out here. There was no version of me joining this family and me not doing everything I could to fit in."</p><p id=eC5XTHCfvsG_ data-wc=14></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbOue5FpaWtpYmaCcoGYcGlqZ52atKmtzWapmqGel7y4ecKoo6itoqh6p63Rnq6epJxiwbDB0Wg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./meet-hollywood-lawyer-new-celebrity-apprentice-q-a-958937.html><span>←</span><span>Meet the Hollywood Lawyer on The New Celebrity Apprentice (Q&amp;amp;A)</span></a>
