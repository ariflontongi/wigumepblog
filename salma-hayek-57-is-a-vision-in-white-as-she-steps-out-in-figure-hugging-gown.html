With a smoky-eyed makeup look and a hint of radiant blush, Salma was the perfect blend of classic and contemporary.</p><p id=eFTDoMnqSgy data-wc=32>However, her appearance at TIFF bore significance beyond just the premiere. The backdrop was the ongoing Hollywood strikes, with the Writer's Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA unions staging protests against the studios.&nbsp;</p><p id=eoF4Otmn6tx data-wc=29>Despite not starring in the film, Salma, in her capacity as the producer, showed solidarity by donning a SAG-AFTRA shirt during the festival, as mentioned by The Hollywood Reporter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/36cc50343bb9-gettyimages-1679537745.jpg><p id=eLEEcqRLZi_ data-wc=23>Conveying her commitment to the cause, she told the outlet: "I received permission from the union to appear at TIFF for the film."&nbsp;</p><p id=eWp3TsUt9Ps data-wc=64>The Christmas-themed movie revolves around a Mexican family's holiday celebrations in the nation's capital. Diving deep into the plot, Salma shared with THR: "Misunderstandings in families have to do with generational differences. It’s not only a Spanish (language) film but a distinctly Mexican one. We're profoundly grateful to showcase it in Toronto, with the union's support, for without their permission, I wouldn’t have come."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fe3de1c2b4b5-gettyimages-1679537753.jpg><p id=ejQ0PdyQRWM data-wc=55>The narrative of the movie weaves three distinct storylines, with one particularly poignant plot focusing on an estranged daughter's hope to mend fences with her family. Reflecting on this storyline, Salma expressed to Variety: "With family, acceptance often precedes understanding. However, it's essential to reach that understanding, ensuring love without reservations rather than mere tolerance."</p><p id=e0Q-_Hz-WU6 data-wc=45>Adding depth to this perspective, the film's writer, Jose Tamez, remarked: "I intended to portray three narratives centered around love. As a member of the gay community, this story deeply resonated with me. I believed its universal appeal would touch hearts, irrespective of personal circumstances."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f98bf2254aba-salma-hayek-husband.jpg><p id=egRtWwi773e data-wc=22>El Sabor De La Navidad is a brainchild of director Alejandro Lozano, starring the talented Mariano Treviño, Pamela Almanza, and Andrés Almeida.</p><p id=eVzfnach73H data-wc=36>Beyond TIFF, Salma's recent days have been filled with gratitude and reflection. She marked her 57th birthday with a series of stunning beach photographs, capturing serene moments in the ocean and playful times on the shore.&nbsp;</p><p id=eeSev610MAj data-wc=58>Expressing her heartfelt sentiments, she shared: "I'm so happy to be alive and profoundly grateful for all blessings – my cherished family, treasured friends, robust health, the fulfilling work, my empowering team, the bond with animals & nature, and the unwavering love of all my fans."
