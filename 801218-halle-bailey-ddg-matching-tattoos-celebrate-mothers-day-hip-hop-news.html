"Now this is the matching tattoo I can get down with," one user wrote. Another added: "I won’t get my partners name, but I’ll get my child’s name tatted." One user joked: "She just so happy to be spending DDG money all the time."

I don’t think 50/50 is a thing when you have money. Me and her have money so it’s a little different. For the most part, as a man, you know she will never pay for dinner, she will never pay for an Uber or trips and flights and stuff. I feel like that’s definitely my job. When it comes to our child, it’s a little different. We might split a night nurse here and there, you know what I mean? It ain’t even about the money, it’s just the principle, you know? The baby [is] 50/50.”</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-halle-bailey-amp-ddg-get-matching-tattoos>Halle Bailey & DDG Get Matching Tattoos</h2></span><p>About The Author</p><p>Cole Blake is currently an Editor at HotNewHipHop based out of Brooklyn, New York.
