After hanging out with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Wayne</a> and other rappers in the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">early days of her career</a>, she felt pressure to get butt injections in order to keep up with the women they were bringing around and praising. Minaj is clearly very confident in herself and has been candid about her history of cosmetic procedures. Rather than continuing to amp up her voluptuous figure, this weekend she seemingly revealed that she underwent a breast reduction.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As @theshaderoom reports, the "Moment 4 Life" artist expressed a desire to make her chest smaller after recovering from the birth of Papa Bear nearly three years ago. "I should've took them off then," Minaj reflected during an Instagram Live session in 2022, revealing advice she got to get the surgery a while back from another woman in the industry. "Is you ready for that?" her friend asked. "Yes! A-cup season," the Trinidadian joked, obviously desperate to get some weight off of her chest.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-nicki-minaj-flaunts-her-new-body>Nicki Minaj Flaunts Her "New Body"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">On Sunday (June 11), Minaj's IG account lit up with a video teasing her and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ice Spice</a>'s upcoming <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">collaboration from the Barbie movie</a>. Throughout the teaser, the Queen hitmaker shows off various makeup looks and outfits. Among them is a white tank top which she's obviously opted out of wearing a bra under. Though she didn't address the apparent difference in her chest in the original caption, Minaj did drop by the comments to write, "New boobs who dis?" unofficially confirming that she went through with her plans for a breast reduction.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In other news, Nicki Minaj is the latest celebrity to fall victim to a "swatting" prank, which she reportedly plans to take legal action over. It was revealed this past weekend that someone contacted the authorities with allegations of child abuse against the Queen of Rap, along with other untrue claims.
