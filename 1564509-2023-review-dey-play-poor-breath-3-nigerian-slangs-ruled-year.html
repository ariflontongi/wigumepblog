This is commonly used for questioning a person's sanity. It's mostly used on social media to question someone's inexplicable behaviour.</p><h2>Let the poor breathe: Originated by Bola Tinubu</h2><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">President Bola Tinubu</a> popularised this slogan during the 2023 election campaign by using it frequently.</p><p class=align-left>This is a plea for the government or other powerful entities to consider the plight of <a href=#>the poor and powerless</a> in making their decisions.

It means to keep on wasting time and not take anything seriously.</p><p class=align-left>"Dey play" is a saying that encourages individuals to work harder and take life less lightly, and it often appears in videos in which the owner brags about material possessions like a new house or car.</p><h2>No evidence by singer Burna Boy</h2><p class=align-left>This came from Burna Boy's <a href=#>iconic meme</a>, "You go explain tire, no evidence".</p><p class=align-left>This means that one's explanation will not hold water if one cannot provide evidence to support their claims. It also indicates when you have not worked hard to reap benefits.</p><h2>Japa-has continued to hold water since 2022:</h2><p class=align-left>The word "Japa" means "to run quickly" in the Yoruba language, from which it was borrowed. It was popularised in 2022 and has become a trend in Nigerian society.</p><p class=align-left>But when Nigerian youths say "Japa," they refer to the eagerness to leave the country overseas to study, work, or <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">for other reasons</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6ec1511e55889aa9.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Poverty: First Christmas under Tinubu would be worst", says ex-APC spokesperson</span></p></a><h2>Burna Boy points out worldwide social media nuisance</h2><p class=align-left>The multi-award-winning <a href=#>Nigerian musician</a> publicly stated his distaste for Twitter users and generally tagged them as "mad."</p><p class=align-left>In an interview on Henrie's hotline Kiss FM, the Last Last singer was asked what he would like to bring for discussion, and he immediately declared his hatred for all X (formerly known as Twitter) users.</p><p class=align-left>He stated that he initially assumed that the strange behaviour was peculiar to Nigerian users and might differ in other countries.
