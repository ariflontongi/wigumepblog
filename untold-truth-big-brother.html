However, <a href=#>some contestants allege</a> that it's also where producers sometimes try to plant thoughts in their heads about who to eliminate or who to keep in order to make the game more exciting. Some contestants say producers use the "power of suggestion" to try to get houseguests to see things a certain way.</p><p>"They don't come out and say, 'Oh, Ryan's going to evict you, how do you feel about that?' or 'Allison said this about you,'" said season nine contestant Sheila Kennedy.

Are you playing this game, or are you just going to lay down and die?'"&nbsp;</p><p>Still, other contestants say&nbsp;Big Brother is about as pure as reality shows come. Big Brother All-Stars winner Mike "Boogie" Malin said that while there's always "conjecture" that producers manipulate the game to keep their favorites around, he thinks it's "totally false."
