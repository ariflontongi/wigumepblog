For these women sex is only for fun and to get a release.</p><p>They want it as often as possible and if the opportunity presents itself they often respond positively with a phrase like - ''you only live once'' Y.O.L.O.</p><p><strong>4- To Get Back At Him</strong></p><p>When some women feel played, used and dumped they will sometimes feel to revenge the guy but not only the guy in questions some will take it as a task to make sure that all male must pay for her heartache.</p><p>Instead of understanding they where with a bad man they scream out the victim song and bind all men together as one, by sleeping around they are hoping to hurt other men like they have been hurt not realizing that in the long run they are only hurting themselves and making a quite healthy number of men happy.</p><p><strong>5- To Forget Their Ex</strong></p><p>Some women also do use meaningless sex as a method to forget their exes. They sleep with a lot of men in order to get over the emotional pain of letting a very loved one go and to fill the big void it left in there heart. But these kind will usually stop sleeping around when they are ready for a new boyfriend.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHmAmGtloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-was-the-school-of-chocolate-winner-and-what-was-the-prize-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who was the School Of Chocolate winner and what was the prize?</span></a>
