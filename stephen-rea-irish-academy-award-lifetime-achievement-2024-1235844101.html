The evening will be hosted by&nbsp;Baz Ashmawy,&nbsp;one of Ireland’s most popular TV personalities.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“So much of Irish culture has been recovered and reimagined: music, language, literature, theater,” Rea said. “And cinema can be added to that list because of the special energy of John Boorman who produced Neil Jordan’s first film Angel. And to my astonishment, my first film too. Neil thrust the script and a saxophone into my hands, and suddenly I was in the movies. Well, one really original movie, which was at the beginning of a new confidence in Irish cinema.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">IFTA lauded Rea for having worked “with renowned filmmakers, such as Mike Leigh and Robert Altman,” and having “appeared on screen with stars including Emily Blunt, Daniel Craig, Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson, Cillian Murphy, Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore, Isabelle Huppert, Martin Sheen, Annette Bening, Robert Downey Jr., Kate Beckinsale, Paul Dano, Lily James, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Colin Firth, Julia Roberts, Colin Farrell, Helena Bonham Carter, Andie McDowell, Forest Whitaker, Jim Broadbent, Laura Linney, Kathy Bates, Maggie Smith, and Miranda Richardson.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He received an Oscar nomination in 1992 for his lead role in&nbsp;The Crying Game “as morally conflicted IRA kidnapper Fergus who becomes embroiled in a complex romance in Troubles-era London,” IFTA said. “The nuance Stephen brought to this portrayal of an Irish Republican opened the eyes of an international audience to the complicated nature of the violence happening here.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">IFTA also highlighted: “He has appeared in big-screen and small-screen blockbusters like&nbsp;V For Vendetta, Underworld: Awakening&nbsp;and&nbsp;War & Peace, as well as roles in award-winning TV series, such as&nbsp;The English&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Honourable Woman. His enduring passion and commitment to theater has remained steadfast.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Rea has won three IFTA Awards out of nine overall nominations. He has also received three BAFTA TV Awards nominations and won a BAFTA in 2015 as best supporting actor for his role in The Honourable Woman.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">IFTA CEO&nbsp;Áine Moriarty&nbsp;lauded the star’s work and accomplishments.&nbsp;“As a pioneer of his craft, Stephen’s profound contribution to our industry has left an indelible mark,” she said. “He brings such an intelligent and intuitive approach to his craft and his performances, with authentic depth and honesty, and a uniquely Irish stoicism.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Concluded the IFTA boss: “He has become one of Ireland’s most respected and beloved actors. His commitment to the craft and to our community has made him an integral part of our cinematic history and the legacy of Irish film, theater and television.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The 2024 IFTA Award nominations will be unveiled&nbsp;on Thursday, March 14.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofLTAxKmfnqZdp7KieciroKygXZaworDEprBmmaeWv6V5y6KdnqyZorJurcKhoJ6ulaKyr8CMa2drbF1mf3SBl21ramhhZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./stephanie-maria-shepherd-net-worth-html.html><span>←</span><span>Stephanie Maria Shepherd Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</span></a>
