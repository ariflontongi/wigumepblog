This past weekend, LL Cool J and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Eminem</a> linked up in Slim Shady's hometown to take a few photos. The pair also grabbed a bite to eat at the 8 Mile star's Mom's Spaghetti restaurant, though it seems their afternoon out together may have left another famous artist experiencing some serious FOMO.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As HipHopDX reports, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>The Roots</a> star Questlove commented on Cool's recent Instagram post commerating his day out with Eminem. "When legends hit the city, you know it‚Äôs always on! üí™üèæ&nbsp;@llcoolj&nbsp;and&nbsp;@eminem&nbsp;linked up ahead of tonight‚Äôs F.O.R.C.E Tour in Detroit and the pics say it all," the caption on @rockthebell's IG post reads. Beneath it, Quest chimed in, "Damn son why didn‚Äôt he pull up? He shoulda rocked [with] us!"</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-eminem-and-ll-cool-j-hit-up-mom-s-spaghetti-in-detroit>Eminem and LL Cool J Hit Up Mom's Spaghetti in Detroit</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It seems Quest was hoping to have seen the "Mockingbird" hitmaker at The Roots' Detroit concert with LL Cool J, but the opportunity was missed. There were still plenty of other household names in the building, however, including <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Bone Thugs</a>-n-Harmony, MC Lyte, Ice-T, and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Common</a> all made appearances on stage as guests. Now that the multi-talent has made his desire to rock with Em clear, we can only hope that the two creatives will have the chance to join forces the next time The Roots put on a show in Michigan.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Speaking of missed musical opportunities, earlier this month LL Cool J reflected on his joint album with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>50 Cent</a> that never saw the light of day. While hip-hop heads would still love to hear the project on DSPs, it doesn't seem likely that we will anytime soon.
