I wandered again to my home in the mountains
Where in youth's early dawn I was happy and free
I looked for my friends but I never could find them
I found they were all rank strangers to meEverybody I met seemed to be a rank stranger
No mother or dad not a friend could I see
They knew not my name and I knew not their faces
I found they were all rank strangers to me.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Actress Claire Malis Callaway Dies at 69</h2><time>Aug 26, 2024</time>
