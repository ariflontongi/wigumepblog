"It's two different ones because some people say he wasn't talking about me. But, he was clearly talking about me. When Drake was saying 'the Rubi Rose two-tone.' That one because it's f*cking Drake." When Complex shared the interview on Instagram, fans shared several laughs at Rose's expense. "Smh pretty girls never beating them stupid allegations," one fan joked. Another added: "Not her celebrating like she just won the lottery or something."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-rubi-rose-attends-hawks-wizards-game>Rubi Rose Attends Hawks-Wizards Game</h2></span><p>ATLANTA, GEORGIA - NOVEMBER 01: Rapper Rubi Rose attends the game between the Atlanta Hawks and the Washington Wizards at State Farm Arena on November 01, 2023, in Atlanta, Georgia.
