And Punta Cana is one of the safest areas in the country. Probably, this is one of the reasons why it is the most visited destination in the Caribbean.</span></span><h2>Which Bahama island is safest?</h2>Eleuthera is known as one of the Bahamas Family or Out Islands, which are generally considered to be much safer than New Providence and the capital city of Nassau.<h2>Why you shouldn't go to the Bahamas?</h2>Violent crime is extremely common in the Bahamas. The country is ridden with violent crime, and armed robberies, kidnappings, and murders are extremely common, usually not affecting tourists though violence towards foreigners has been on an increase during the past couple of years.<h2>Is Cancun or the Bahamas safer?</h2>If you're staying in Nassau, it's no safer to travel around the whole island than it is the area around Punta Cana or the hotel strip in Cancun. If you don't know where to go, and where to stay away from, it could be worse on New Providence.<h2>Which is better the Bahamas or the Caribbean?</h2>While the Caribbean undoubtedly has more options as far as a destination, you can't beat the convenience of The Bahamas. No matter which itinerary you go with, you're going to see some amazing wildlife, lush vegetation and beautiful beaches.<h2>Difference Between All-Inclusive Resorts in Mexico and Dominican Republic</h2><p></p><h2>Are The Bahamas safe?</h2>Country Summary: The vast majority of crime occurs on New Providence (Nassau) and Grand Bahama (Freeport) islands. In Nassau, exercise caution in the “Over the Hill” area (south of Shirley Street). Violent crime, such as burglaries, armed robberies, and sexual assault occur, but generally not in tourist areas.<h2>Is Jamaica or The Bahamas better?</h2>Both Jamaica and the Bahamas offer a good variety of water sports activities, beaches, and nightlife, but if you're more into cultural activities, Jamaica is the solid winner.

We stayed at the Atlantis on Paradise Island, and while the water is pretty and calm there, the Bahamas do not compare to Cancun at all. The service and people of Cancun are 1st class. The service in the Bahamas (at least in our experience) was far from perfect.<h2>Is Aruba better than Punta Cana?</h2>In our case, Punta Cana is several times cheaper in terms of hotels, activities, restaurants than Aruba. Despite this, the level and resort standards are high in both destinations. Punta Cana is a resort-oriented town. The Atlantic Ocean meets the warmer Caribbean Sea here, so it is also a good place for watersports.<h2>Which is safer Bermuda or Bahamas?</h2>Safety.
