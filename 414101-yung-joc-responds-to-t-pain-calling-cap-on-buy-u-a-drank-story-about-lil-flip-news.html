One tale about <a href=# class=text-word rel>T-Pain</a>'s "Buy U A Drank" caught fans by surprise after the Rap veteran claimed that the classic 2007 track came about after an awkward encounter. According to VladTV, the Love & Hip Hop star said that<a href=# rel> Lil Flip swerved T-Pain and this inspired the song</a>. The details painted the autotune icon as a fan for who Flip didn't have time.&nbsp;</p><p>“We about to go do this big ass car show, this n*gga T-Pain was like, ‘Oh god, I wanna meet Lil Flip. I wanna meet Lil Flip, I’m his biggest fan.' I’m like, Really? Oh, well I f*ck with Flip.”</p><p></p><p>Joc then said he attempted to introduce his two peers but things didn't go as he expected.</p><p>“Pain gon' hate me for this, Pain was like, ‘Eh, put ‘er there,'” he said as he mimicked T-Pain's handshake attempt. "<a href=# rel>‘Put ‘er there,</a>’ like on some white boy sh*t. 'Hey put ‘er there, chum,’ like, Flip wasn’t feeling none of that. Flip was like, ‘N*gga,’ and walked off. I was like, damn. That sh*t hurt Pain feelings a lot a bit. Not 'a little bit,' a lot a bit!"</p><p>"We go do the show, Pain come back he like, ‘Man, that sh*t really f*cked me up with Flip.’ I’m like, 'F*ck that shit man let’s go get something to drink!' He’s like ‘Man,’ I’m like 'N*gga, <a href=# rel>drinks on me n*gga</a>, I’m buying all the shots.'" Not long after, Joc said T-Pain made his hit song and asked him to hop on the track.&nbsp;</p><p>Andy Lyons / Staff / Getty Images</p><p>After The Shade Room reposted the clip of Joc's interview, T-Pain slid in the comment section with a "cap" emoji. Joc took notice and responded.</p><p>"He is absolutely right, the title that The Shade Room put up there is cap. I never said T-Pain made 'Buy U a Drank' because of that situation. That's not what I said.&nbsp;<a href=# rel>That's what he's sayin' cap.</a> The situation happened exactly the f*ck the way I said it happened. That's on my mama. That's exactly how the f*ck it happened."</p><p>Joc added that someone can tell T-Pain to do a VladTV interview of his own to share his side of the story. "I never said he made 'Buy U a Drank' because of that moment."
