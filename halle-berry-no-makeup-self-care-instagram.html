Her gorgeous hair is flowing as she sits in a gorgeous, natural setting.</p><p>Now, we love how often Berry posts bare-faced photos, both showing her natural glow and showing the world that natural beauty should be a celebrated part of life. She often posts these photos in gorgeous settings we daydream about later, which adds to the entire natural goddess effect.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=noopener>Moonfall </a>star said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">HelloGiggles</a> that as she ages, she believes “less is more” with a makeup routine. “I haven’t done much makeup during this pandemic. I’ve been more natural and have focused on maintaining healthy skin. I love makeup and experimenting with it, but as you age, I think less makeup serves you well.”</p><p>Now, we all know Berry is a self-care Queen, posting fitness inspiration and more no-makeup selfies with <a href=# rel=noopener>her love Van Hunt.</a> In another interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Harper’s Bazaar</a>, she said she swears by self-care Sundays, saying “I love Self-Care Sundays, and finding time to read or meditate, do yoga, things that you can easily do at home. Finding time to destress has been very important for me…”</p><p>She added, “I’m just going to be me, and there’s power in that.”</p><p><strong>Before you go, click <a href=# rel=noopener>here</a> to see Halle Berry’s best red carpet photos over the years.</strong><br><a href=# rel=noopener><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/halle-berry-red-carpet-graphic-.jpg alt="Halle Berry Best Red Carpet Photos" width=693 height=390 sizes="(min-width: 87.5rem) 1000px, (min-width: 78.75rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jp6lrZ2iqa6qusyepa1nkafBqq%2FLnqpoamVpgnF8kGifmqScmnqjsdGrsGamn2K6orfErqdmq5Whs26vwKucZqGeqMGis9GapGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-young-han-solo-has-been-cast-in-star-wars-prequel.html><span>←</span><span>Find out who has been cast as a young Han Solo for Star Wars prequel</span></a>
