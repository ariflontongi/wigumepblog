His oldest son Danny (Donnie Wahlberg) is a seasoned detective and Iraqi War veteran who occasionally uses dubious tactics to solve cases, while daughter Erin (Bridget Moynahon) is an assistant district attorney. Fresh out of Harvard Law, Jamie (Will Estes) is the youngest member and "golden boy" of the family, who gave up a lucrative future in law to continue the family's tradition in police work.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9949194311cd-bluebloods.jpg><p id=e5TLHlj44a data-wc=32>Abigail stars as Detective Abigail Hawk, a member of the Police Commissioner's squad who serves as the primary aide to Frank.

Will and Bridget, all command similar salaries of $100,000 per episode, although those figures aren't confirmed.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
