Fonda stepped on the carpet for the premiere of Le Deuxième Acte (or The Second Act for non-French speakers) on May 14, wearing a black beaded Elie Saab jumpsuit and a glamorous leopard-print coat by Forte Forte.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jonathan Harris Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</h2><time>Aug 31, 2024</time>
