She and Bruce wed in Vegas four months after their initial introduction. Less than a year later, the pair welcomed their first daughter together, Rumer. Moore and Willis share two additional daughters together: Scout and Tallulah (born in 1991 and 1994, respectively).</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ron Galella, Ltd./Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked:</strong> According to a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rolling Stone</a> interview with Moore from the mid-‘90s, the Ghost star once posted a fax (A. FAX.) from her husband on her trailer wall that read: “How are you, my angel? Is you at work or what?… . . . Do you still look the same? Fax my ass or something! Love, your ever-lovin’ Daddio.” Creepy father-figure reference aside, I think I’ve found my new favorite phrase: “Fax my ass or something.” Does anyone love you enough to demand a fax, of all things? I think not.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ron Wolfson/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them:</strong> She has an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>entire Victorian house filled with dolls</a>! He wants you to "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>go f—k yourself</a>"! Bruce and Demi were both so unapologetically strange and uninhibited that their relationship felt destined for combustion. And OK, it ultimately did, but it lasted about a decade longer than anyone expected. To this day, Moore and Willis remain close friends and co-parents.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Breakup: Throughout their relationship, Willis and Moore were constantly hitting back at tabloid speculation that they were heading toward divorce. Creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts, in 1993 Demi told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Vanity Fair</a> that the media “won’t stop until one day they may be right.” In the summer of 1998, after nearly 11 years of marriage, the tabloids won and the high-profile couple announced their separation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As with any divorce, there are myriad reasons the marriage ultimately fell apart — and while we’ll never truly know what went down between the two, the internet has supplied us with plenty of speculation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The most cited reason is also the most typical of a Hollywood split: their busy schedules kept them from spending <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>enough time together</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>E!</a> speculated that Moore and Willis put off the divorce so they wouldn’t have to handle the financial complication. Considering the split <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>reportedly cost the Die Hard star a whopping $90 million</a>, it’s a reasonable hypothesis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another reported issue was Willis’s flagrant love of women (as in, women he wasn’t married to). While Moore reportedly bristled at Willis working with younger women (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People reported</a> that she was outraged to find Bruce’s Armageddon co-star Liv Tyler paying a visit to their Idaho home), the actor didn’t curb his gasp-inducing comments about the opposite sex.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a 1996 interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Playboy</a> (written by <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow">Beautiful Boy</a> author David Sheff),Willis made it clear that a single woman could not meet his sexual needs. “What is marriage?" he asked. “No woman is going to satisfy a man’s natural impulse to procreate, procreate, procreate. The impulse doesn’t go away because you have three or ten or a hundred kids.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We try hard, but we’re animals,” he continued. “We’re just donkeys walking up to the trough for food and wanting to f—k everything we see because of this unconscious agenda. If you’re heterosexual and you are honest, you must admit that the first thing that comes to mind when you look at a woman is, Hey, I’d like to f—k her. We have to admit it. It’s programmed in our genetic map. You’re not thinking, Oh, there’s a good childbearer. I could have a good brood of apes with her. It’s unconscious. All you’re thinking is, Mmmm, yes. I’ll take you and you … "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now: </strong>Five years after finalizing her divorce from Willis, Moore wed actor Ashton Kutcher, 40.
