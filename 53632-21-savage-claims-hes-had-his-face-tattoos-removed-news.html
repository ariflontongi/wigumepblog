With all that being said, it seems crazy that 21 would choose to remove the tattoo, but a new Snapchat story from the rapper finds him claiming just that -- though it's unclear if he's trolling his fans.</p><p>“Just got all my tattoos removed,” he says in the clip, showing off a newly clear forehead. “Changed man now. Finna go to church.”</p><p>The snap seems like it could easily be a very well orchestrated joke, but how did he cover up the tattoo if this is the case? Make-up? A custom Snapchat filter?</p><p>Think this is for real?
