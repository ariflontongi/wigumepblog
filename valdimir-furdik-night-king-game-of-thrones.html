Other than his rugged handsomeness, I mean.</p><h2 id=he-apos-s-a-crazy-good-stuntman-3>He's a crazy-good stuntman.</h2><p>Furdík has been in the movie business for a long time: He most notably worked on&nbsp;Skyfall,&nbsp;Robin Hood&nbsp;(2010),&nbsp;and&nbsp;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, but it looks like he's been working since the 1990s.&nbsp;</p><p>I mean, just look at the skill:</p><p>There's a zero percent chance I wouldn't stab myself right in the eyeball, which is (clearly the only reason) why I'm not a stuntwoman.</p><h2 id=he-actually-replaced-the-original-night-king-actor-3>He actually replaced the original Night King actor.</h2><p>The Night King was played by Richard Brake in seasons 4 and 5. Furdík is the White Walker that Jon Snow kills with his Valyrian steel sword in season 5. (Remember that guy—<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o2ZlJP9K3o" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>the look of shock</a>&nbsp;when his weapon makes contact with Jon's sword before he's exploded into a million pieces of ice?

It wasn’t just the one time; it was maybe 15 times. When I have to hold her under the jaw and it looks like she dies, we had to spend a lot of energy on that particular scene.</p><p>"It was very, very difficult. We are very good friends. We know each other. It wasn’t easy for me to [pretend to] hurt her. When I grabbed her under the jaw, it wasn’t easy [on a practical level].</p><p>"If you make a bad move—if you don’t grab her well—she could have an injury. So I was under pressure and she was under pressure. It was not an easy day."</p><p>He doesn't speak in this featurette, but you can see how they got the shot using multiple sets and setups (it's towards the end):</p><h2 id=his-method-for-the-night-king-bran-scene-was-hilarious-3>His method for the Night King-Bran scene was hilarious.</h2><p>Speaking to&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/game-of-thrones-vladimir-furdik-night-king-interview.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Vulture</a>, Furdik said that director Miguel Sapochnik told him, "Bran, he is not man. He is a cake. And you would like to eat this cake. And I would like to see you acting, you’re walking to him, you’re walking like you’re looking for that cake, which is waiting for you under the tree."</p><p>He added, "When I walk, you can see what Miguel said: 'Don’t be a soldier. No. Just walk, confident. There’s a cake.'" I love it.
