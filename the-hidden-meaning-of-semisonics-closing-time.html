After years of touring for four nights a week, the group grew bored with closing out each night with the same track. "My bandmates were tired of ending our sets with the same song, so there was kind of an uprising where they demanded something different to end our nights with," said Wilson. "So I thought, "OK, I'll write a song to close out the set," and then boom, I wrote "Closing Time" really fast."</p><p>Yet, the song began to take on a whole new life of its own once Wilson received some big news. Per <a href=#>Billboard</a>, Wilson's girlfriend told the frontman that she was pregnant, which prompted the lyric-heavy tune relating to life, birth and fatherhood. "We had spent seven years of our lives at that point, four nights a week entertaining people. That was our life," WIlson told <a href=#>Billboard</a>. "Some bouncers yelling things, closing time coming, all that imagery, literally, that's how the song started and then when I was halfway done, I started realizing the whole thing was a pun about being born, so I just made sure that the rest of the thing could ride with that double meaning, but nobody got the joke and I didn't bother to explain."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2Bkmpnbm1fqbWmeceim52dnmK6pq3NoqWgZZ%2BberSxzKKqqKaZmMBur8uoqqKml2LBqrnEaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-leather-sneakers-7373273.html><span>←</span><span>The 14 Best Leather Sneakers of 2024</span></a>
