Speaking with several outlets, including <a href=#>Page Six</a>, Allen proclaimed, "She was the most diverse and tolerant woman I've ever known for a long time, so whatever got in her head isn't the Roseanne I know."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>The "Home Improvement" star went on to criticize cancel culture in general, noting, "As a stand-up comic, it's a very dangerous position for me to be in because I like pushing buttons and we're all very sensitive." And while he said he would respect ABC's decision, he was adamant that it was the wrong one. "I know Barr, and she's just not that person," he told reporters.</p><p dir=ltr>Allen wasn't the only one to publicly support Barr. In the days following her cancellation, she was backed up by tweets from fellow Republicans, like <a href=#>Ted Nugent</a>, <a href=#>Anthony Scaramucci</a>, and <a href=#>Tomi Lahren</a>. As for Barr herself, she blamed her medication. In a since-deleted tweet, saved by <a href=#>Time</a>, the comedian argued, "Not giving excuses for what I did (tweeted) but I've done weird stuff while on ambien." Sanofi, the maker of Ambien, clapped back, <a href=#>tweeting</a>, "While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampgbYR0fI6hprBlpJ66bq3LpZynZZOWuqZ506hkq6ejmq6vusRmmZqqoqh6pbHFnqWsnV2Ws7Wx0WaqoZ1dnLy1ecKapZydnJqxcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-much-money-does-phillippi-sparks-make-latest-phillippi-sparks-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><span>←</span><span>How Much Money Does Phillippi Sparks Make?
