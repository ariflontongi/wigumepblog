He shared an alleged audio clip of 6ix9ine taking the stand in court. In the clip, 6ix9ine tells the court his name, age, and aliases before informing them of the crimes the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods committed such as drug dealing and shooting.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What's interesting about the clip is that he admits that he decided he was going to cooperate with the police shortly after his arrest. The thing is, his lawyers denied that he was going to&nbsp;testify against his co-defendants once the rumors hit. It was only until early 2019 that documents revealed that he was going to snitch on everyone in order to get a shortened sentence.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">6ix9ine's trial is expected to last for the next two weeks. Stay&nbsp;tuned for more updates on the rapper's federal case.&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
