In terms of stat priority, you'll want a Cryo damage bonus artifact, and then critical damage, critical rate, attack, and energy recharge for her costly burst.<h2>Will Ayaka be a Cryo DPS?</h2>Cryo DPS Build. Ayaka is one of the best Cryo Main DPS character in-game. She can deal consistent Cryo DMG with all of her skills. This build focuses on increasing all of her skills from Normal attack to Elemental Burst.<h2>Will Ayaka be physical or Cryo?</h2>However, Ayaka's attacks are infused with Cryo after her Alternate Sprint, so building her on Physical will minimize her potential. Instead, players should maximize Ayaka's damage by building her with Cryo. Doing so will enhance her whole kit; Normal attack, Elemental Skill, and Elemental Burst.<h2>Does Ayaka need a Cryo battery?</h2>Give Ayaka A Cryo Battery<p>Ayaka's Burst is one of the strongest single abilities in the game, so naturally, you want to be able to use it as soon as it comes off cooldown. Unfortunately, Ayaka's Energy generation is not the highest, with her infrequent Skill being her primary source of Cryo Particles.</p><h2>AYAKA ATK% VS CRYO% GOBLET + Opinion on Blackliff | The Black Sword | Genshin Impact</h2><p></p><h2>Can Ayaka be a main DPS?</h2>Ayaka's burst is the money maker of her kit. It's the reason Ayaka is a powerful Main DPS. This summons a whirlwind that continuously deals Cryo damage. This burst deals an extremely high amount of damage, and is the main source of damage for Ayaka.<h2>Is Kaeya a good battery for Ayaka?</h2>Furthermore, Kaeya also makes a great Cryo support. His Elemental Skill generates a decent amount of energy, so he can be a good battery for Ayaka.<h2>Is Ayaka stronger than Xiao?</h2>Ayaka, being a Cryo DPS, would benefit from reaction damage as well, it is not that hard to understand the logic here. Xiao is considered a great DPS character by many Genshin Impact players, so for there to be some leakers claiming that Ayaka's DPS will surpass Xiao's is quite impressive.<h2>Is Ayaka or Ayato better?</h2>Turns out being the younger of the two siblings gave Ayaka an advantage. Her in-game talents are more generous and more creative compared to Ayato. Ayaka's main advantage when it comes to talents is that her dodge/evade or sprint is a Cryo version of Mona's, making her one of the best characters for exploration.<h2>Is Ayaka The cryo Archon?</h2>Kamisato Ayaka (Japanese: 神 かみ 里 さと 綾 あや 華 か ) [Note 1] is a playable Cryo character in Genshin Impact.<h2>Will Ayaka be better than ganyu?</h2>Interestingly, in terms of damage, Ayaka overshadows Ganyu easily. However, Ganyu is a very versatile character and arguably is the only character to fulfill both roles perfectly. Therefore, she can be an immense help in Spiral Abyss as well as open-world challenges.<h2>Is Ayaka stronger than EULA?</h2>One advantage Ayaka has is that she can produce better elemental reactions. Her Cryo application is significantly more thorough than Eula's; whose Cryo abilities mostly just buff up her physical damage. As such, Ayaka's teams can be more fun and dynamic as she isn't pigeonholed into one damage type.<h2>Is Ayaka in love with the traveler?</h2>Ayaka does have some feelings towards the Traveler, and that has been quite evident in the game. However, it is emphasized that during the Prayer Plaques scene, the Traveler is only thinking about reuniting with their sibling which makes Ayaka believe that they are not meant to be together.<h2>Are tohma and Ayaka engaged?</h2>Connection to Ayaka<p>There is a common misconception going around on Twitter that Ayaka is romantically involved with Tohma, particularly as his fiancé. Shipping them together is fine, but there isn't any direct, credible leak that supports this.</p><h2>Is Ayaka good with Hu Tao?</h2>Ayaka is also a strong DPS unit on her own, easily capable of shouldering the role alongside Hu Tao. If used back-to-back, Ayaka and Hu Tao's Bursts can do absolutely massive damage together, a popular combo for clearing Spiral Abyss floors.<h2>Should I roll for Ayaka?</h2>With that said, if you are in dire need of a Cryo DPS, we highly recommend that you pull for Ayaka, as she will, without a shadow of a doubt take your team to new rights, thanks to both her playstyle and her ability to work extremely well with the game's farmable 4-star Sword Amenoma Kageuchi, which can be considered ...<h2>Is Ayaka good with kazuha?</h2>Kazuha is an incredible support to pair with Ayaka. He can provide insane buffs to any Element, thanks to his Passive and the Viridescent Venerer set. This can increase Ayaka's Cryo damage by a huge degree, allowing her to cut down her foes with ease.<h2>Is Ayaka better than Kaeya?</h2>Because Ayaka is statistically more powerful than Kaeya.<h2>Does Ayaka work with Xingqiu?</h2>Ayaka's Normal Attack animations are very quick, and since she can infuse her own Normal Attacks with Cryo, Ayaka pairs greatly with Xingqiu.<h2>Is Ayaka with Ganyu good?</h2>No, she is a very good support for Ayaka considering that her burst gives a 20% cryo damage bonus to those in the field at A4. Seems like a waste of one of Ganyu or Ayaka, since both want to be main dps. Ayaka's best supports should work as a battery for her.<h2>Is Ayaka good with Ayato?</h2>Now that he's in Genshin Impact, it's incredibly satisfying to see how well Ayato and Ayaka work together. To start, Cryo and Hydro are two elements that work well together. The Elemental Reaction between the two will freeze characters.<h2>Is Ayaka good with Zhongli?</h2>One of Zhongli's greatest abilities is his Elemental Skill shield, which makes him ideal for Ayaka.<h2>Is Rosaria good with Ayaka?</h2>Rosaria is a great alternative battery option and she can help increase Ayaka's crit rate even further with her Shadow Samaritan passive talent – better yet, she will be featuring on Ayaka's rerun banner, so if you don't have her already you will get a chance soon.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8isZJqxkaCubq2MnKmypw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./best-matcha-powders-lattes-1235351770.html><span>←</span><span>Ippodo, Clevr, Matcha Konomi, Laird The Hollywood Reporter</span></a>
