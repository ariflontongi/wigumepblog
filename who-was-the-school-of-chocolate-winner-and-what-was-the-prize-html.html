However, at the age of 19, he made the decision to relocate to Chicago to attend the French Pastry School and also holds a degree from Mariano Moreno Culinary Institute. His dedication paid off, and he became the executive pastry chef at Longman & Eagle at the young age of 24. Additionally, he received a nomination for the prestigious Jean Banchet Award for Rising Star Pastry Chef Of The Year.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Juan Gutierrez’s victory in “School Of Chocolate” comes with a grand prize valued at $100,000.
