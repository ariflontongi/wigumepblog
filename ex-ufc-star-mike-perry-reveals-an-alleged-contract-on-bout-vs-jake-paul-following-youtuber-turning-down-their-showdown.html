As if everyone wasn‚Äôt already aware of how much of an untrustworthy character the former vine star is, Mike Perry recently came forward to reveal a contract he received to fight Jake which later got canceled after the Youtuber pulled out.</p><p>Perry competed in the UFC for 5 years before changing to BKFC (Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship). <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The 31-year-old claimed to get paid more by Bare Knuckle than by UFC</a>.

However, ‚ÄòThe Problem Child‚Äô realized that ‚ÄòCowboy‚Äô was out for money and turned down that fight. Mike also had some history with the cowboy so he wasn‚Äôt willing to pass on a potential rematch,</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>If you‚Äôre looking to box <a href=# rel=noopener>@Cowboycerrone</a> I‚Äôm up for my rematch. . .</p><p>‚Äî Platinum Mike Perry (@PlatinumPerry) <a href=# rel=noopener>January 3, 2023</a></p><h2>Who will Jake Paul actually fight next?</h2><p>Things are not looking very good for Jake Paul. Not many people in the fighting business seem to trust him much and fighting washed-out MMA fighters, YouTubers, and NBA stars have not helped his case at all. Now turning down a seasoned fighter like Perry who is still in his early 30s probably proves the naysayers right.</p><p>Jake has talked about fighting Tommy Fury but that fight doesn‚Äôt have any concrete paper out there.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLzOq6usspmku2%2BvzqZmnrBdqrOkedKtmKtlnZ64pnnPnqmrsV2nsrexwKWqZpmeYq6tuMSgnJ1lk6S7tb7AnKtmp55ir7DB02atrGWalrimec%2BarKVllqS5rbvWoqWgZamkwrXBwZ6pZqylp7uqusZmm6ivnmLBqbHIq2SsoJ%2BssbDDzWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./desmond-ridder-net-worth-304469.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Desmond Ridder Net Worth</span></a>
