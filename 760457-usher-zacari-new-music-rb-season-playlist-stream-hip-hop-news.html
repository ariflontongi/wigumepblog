Moreover, we rounded up the very best of the best new music of the week on our new R&B Season playlist update in this genre's field. While sometimes that genre barrier can become a little blurry, this next collaboration and artist falls firmly in that camp. Of course, we're talking about "The King Of R&B," <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Usher</a>, and his newest team-up with Pheelz, their single "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Ruin</a>." However, while the vocals definitely fit within that style, the Afrobeat-inspired beat makes for a uniquely breezy take that shows off a lot of vocal strength.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Next up on our R&B Season playlist update is the new <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Zacari</a> song, "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Ocean</a>," which is a another smooth and pleasant jam. Of course, the vocalist does very well switching between lower tones and high-pitched falsettos, which gives some nice dynamism to the guitar-led beat. Also, additional production elements such as flanging, atmospheric synth pads, and more add to the emotive punch of the song and make it stand out from a typical ballad. Overall, it's an easy add to a driving playlist or for more chill vibes.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-hnhh-r-amp-b-season-playlist-stream>HNHH R&B Season Playlist: Stream</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Speaking of atmosphere, we'd be remiss not to shout out <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>SAFE</a>'s new song, "Same Night," on this week's R&B Season playlist update. It's another romantic cut that finds strength in its warbled samples and slow, reverb-drenched drum beat with sharp snares and crisp hi-hats. Not only that, but his vocals never overwhelm the instrumentation and vice versa, and it's a very nice balance between tense swells and melancholy valleys. Even though it's not the most eventful track here, it's exactly the kind of mood-setting that much of this genre champions so well.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Finally, we wanted to give a nod to Daniel Caesar's soft and patient cover of "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Waiting In Vain</a>" by Bob Marley, off of One Love – Music Inspired By The Film. This reimagining is definitely more sultry and less joyful than its original, but its strong sentiment and narrative core still holds on tight.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdna311gZZmrKyglad6u63CmqmiZZ6axG651KygnGWil3q0scCspqdloKGuurjIrKtmq6SnsqK5jKGgqWWYpL1uusSwqg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ufc-justin-tafa-claims-first-round-knockout-win-over-harry-hunsucker.html><span>←</span><span>UFC: Justin Tafa claims first-round knockout win over Harry Hunsucker</span></a>
