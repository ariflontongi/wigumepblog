However, it seems they are back together again — if they even broke up at all.</p><p>Aimee has re-followed Wes on Instagram. She also added all their photos back to her account.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>On top of that, Aimee took to her IG Stories and posted something to confirm that she is still with Wes.</p><p>In the post, she said that she was having dinner with Wes and his family. She also had a couple of videos that showed Wes at some event that included a toast being given.</p><p>It was clear that something happened between Aimee and Wes, but it is possible that it was either a misunderstanding or it was something that the two worked out because Aimee is acting like nothing was ever wrong to begin with and it is all back to normal.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Aimee and Wes are still together, unlike other Love Island couples</h2><p>Aimee and Wes left the villa early and lost the chance to be the winning couple on Love Island USA.</p><p>Out of the four couples that made it to the finale, only one is as strong as Aimee and Wes appeared.</p><p><a href=#>Will and Kyra are still together</a>, and they seem like one of the best connections outside of <a href=#>Shannon and Josh</a>, who left early when <a href=#>Josh’s sister died</a>.</p><p>Another finals couple broke up instantly when <a href=#>Charlie and Alana proved they were not going to make it</a> outside the villa.</p><p><a href=#>Jeremy and Bailey were a huge fan favorite</a> after the show ended but he has since told her that he liked someone else outside the villa and broke things off.</p><p>There is still no word on how serious <a href=#>winners Olivia and Korey</a> are.</p><p>Love Island USA is on hiatus. Catch up with all the love connections from Season 3 on Paramount+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ5ykw6Z5yKyjmqaUYsK0rYysq5qqXZa2rrHEZp2lp6KawG6%2Fz56YpKtdpMK1ec6nZLCdo2K8qL%2FBrqmyZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./445907-lil-nas-x-channels-ice-spice-for-halloween.html><span>←</span><span>Lil Nas X Channels Ice Spice For Halloween</span></a>
