That pattern continues.</p><p>The 90 Day Fiance: The Other Way couple were still together earlier this year. Now, they’ve broken up.</p><p>Over the weekend, Rishi announced their split, saying that it was a mutual breakup and that they remain friends.</p><p>Jen says that, actually, that’s not the truth. It wasn’t a mutual split. The “still friends” claim is debatable. And Rishi has since begun dating someone else … desperate to return to 90 Day Fiance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/05/0515_jenboecher_10-1024x576.png><p>Though Jen Boecher and Rishi Singh didn’t exactly have an explosive storyline on 90 Day Fiance: The Other Way Season 4, they had major ups and downs.</p><p>Communication was a factor. Or a lack thereof.</p><p>Most of all, Rishi seemed torn and unable to fully commit to pleasing his family or being with Jen, whom he loved. He wanted the best of both worlds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/05/0522_theotherway_tellall_27_jenboecher_rishisingh-1024x576.png><p>During the Tell All, things were … better. They didn’t seem totally clear on the status of things or their future, but they weren’t exes.</p><p>(In fact, memorably, 90 Day Fiance fan favorite Debbie Aguero wanted to fix Jen up with her adult son, Julian. And Jen did give him her number … just to keep her options open)</p><p>Still, fans have pretty much assumed that they were still together, albeit over long distance. Until Friday, November 3, however.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1106_rishisingh_ig_01-744x1024.png><p>“Jen and I have mutually decided to part ways,” Rishi wrote in a text post late last week.</p><p>“This hasn’t been an easy decision by any measure,” he continued. “But we know it’s the right one at this point in our lives.”</p><p>Rishi concluded: “The love and respect we have will always be, and our shared memories are forever. We part as life partners, but will remain platonic friends.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>That seems like a very normal breakup announcement. But you’d normally expect them both to post it, or to each post their own version.</p><p>Or at least a “like” from Jen, since they’re allegedly still friends.</p><p>Instead, Jen took to Instagram Live and then, later, to her Instagram Story to clear things up. Because she says that Rishi is lying about just about everything.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1106_jenboecher_ig_02.png><p>So, according to Jen, she broke up with Rishi a few months ago. It was not mutual.</p><p>Rishi loved her, she said, and was finally ready to commit. But after years of waiting, her love for him had begun to wither.</p><p>Jen affirmed that the two were still somewhat friendly — but not in regular contact. Friendly doesn’t always mean friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/05/0528_theotherway_tellall_21_jenboecher-1024x576.png><p>Jen had even more to say. And this is where things go beyond a weird, unilateral breakup fib.</p><p>According to her, Rishi had very recently reached out to her to tell her that he was with someone else … who was planning to come visit him.</p><p>Apparently, the new woman had appeared in some capacity on 90 Day Fiance in the past. And Rishi hoped to become engaged to this new gal on a future season of 90 Day Fiance. Ouch!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/11/1106_jenboecher_ig_01-576x1024.jpg><p>There was more. Jen said that she found out that Rishi had been gossiping about her behind her back with other cast members from the show. That’s a betrayal.</p><p>Though Jen doesn’t regret the relationship, she did feel hurt by his actions. His plans to return to the show with a new gal also stung.</p><p>That said, Jen hasn’t ruled out returning to the franchise on 90 Day: The Single Life. Many of us would enjoy watching her find happiness.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2Z%2BcLbEp2Sbp5WYtaa%2BjJ6vqaejmsBuvsisn6Jlo567qLSMmp2tnaJir7OxwKSsqWWRo7uwwc2cnKadnql6qbHSZqOyoZ6cerW7jHJnZpyRrnqntcCnmp5llpa7tHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-it-illegal-to-feed-cats-in-hawaii.html><span>←</span><span>Is it illegal to feed cats in Hawaii?</span></a>
