Together, we have produced three meaningful, diverse shows, and I am looking forward to broadening the scope of our collaboration while also championing new voices. It’s particularly thrilling to return to the enchanted world of Sofia the First, where it all began 10 years ago, and create a follow-up series that is just as magical.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The possible Sofia spinoff would be set at Royal Prep Academy, a school for princes and princesses in the kingdom of Enchancia that Sofia and her step-siblings James and Amber attended.
