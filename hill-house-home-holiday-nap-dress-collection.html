Last year's in-demand tartan nap dresses are also back in adult and children's sizes. The color palette and wintery fabrics are destined for every holiday party. Who cares if it's only October? These pieces can instantly put anyone in the Hill House holiday spirit.</p><img alt="two models wear dresses from hill house home 2021 holiday collection in front of a white window" title="Hill House Home Holiday Nap Dress Collection 2021" width=1707 height=2560 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/20210930-hillhousehome-20210930-hillhousehome-s13-1393-1634612816.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Hill House Home</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Founder Nell Diamond describes the collection as capturing two moods: cozy winter (as seen in tartan nap dresses and toile sweatsuits) and celebratory holiday (dresses in new-to-the-brand materials like velvet and an updated, twinkling brocade). Dressier nap dress styles aren't giving up the comfort that made the brand a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/a36109789/nell-diamond-nap-dress/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="quarantine hit" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">quarantine hit</a>: Hill House's velvet incorporates silk for an extra-soft feel and all dresses include stretch and structure in equal measure.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think one of the things that’s so important to me about the nap dress having gone through having twins last year, and going through so many changes in my body, is being really comfortable while I’m celebrating," Diamond explains of the designs. "It’s something I don’t want to go back on. So we kind of challenged ourselves to create more nap dresses that are seen as really celebratory."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dresses that can comfortably move from formal holiday portraits to a six-hour Thanksgiving dinner are just one reflection of how Hill House Home integrates shoppers' requests into its new lines. The new long-sleeve nap dress topped customers' request lists for months. "Literally every single nap dress we’ve ever made has come from Nap Dress Nation," Diamond says.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The always-listening philosophy extends to other new categories, like tights. "People were constantly asking me last year, where do you get your turtlenecks and tights that go under your Ellies and Athenas?" Diamond had borrowed admittedly expensive styles from her mom's wardrobe—not something she can replicate for customers. Luckily Hill House Home could create tights that are just as opaque and comfortable as Diamond's other favorites, but for $25 per pair.</p><img alt="a woman and a child wear matching tartan dresses by hill house home while sitting at a table" title="Hill House Home Holiday Nap Dress Collection 2021" width=1707 height=2560 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/20210930-hillhousehome-20210930-hillhousehome-s11-1290-1634612870.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Hill House Home</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Diamond's top two styles for holiday parties are the velvet Akilah dress, to wear with pearl necklace and gold, strappy heels, and the velvet Ellie dress, paired with a brown boot and a cardigan tied over the shoulders for a cocktail party. When the parties are over and every gift is unwrapped, Diamond says these nighttime dresses can find a home in your day-to-day wardrobe. "I’ll wear my velvet Ellie to the office all winter long with a turtleneck and a leather jacket."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At Hill House headquarters, Diamond and her team are already developing next year's holiday collection. Finding out what makes the final cut will take a lot of patience on our part. "Sometimes when people on Instagram write that they want something, I’m like, if only you guys knew I’m already working on it—but you’ll have to wait a year!" Diamond laughs.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Until then, there's a dreamy new drop to keep us occupied.
