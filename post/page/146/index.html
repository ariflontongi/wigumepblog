Answer
How to Secure a Rubbermaid Storage Shed
Find the locations of the anchor points on the Rubbermaid shed floor. On order to accommodate ground anchors, each shed has sunken circular areas in the floor.
Using a 1/2-inch drill bit, drill through the recessed anchor sections of the wall.
Fill in the anchor hole with a stake until it meets the earth under the shed floor, then remove the stake.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How do you use roofers choice plastic roof cement?</h2><time>Aug 7, 2024</time>
