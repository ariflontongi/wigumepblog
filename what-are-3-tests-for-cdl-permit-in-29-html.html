checks)!</span><span> You've got your sights set on conquering the open road in a behemoth of a machine,</span><span> a rig that puts the "lux" in luxury yacht...</span><span>of the highway

This test focuses on handling those monstrosities known as combination vehicles,</span><span> the ones with trailers longer than your chances of forgetting your anniversary (hopefully).</span><span> Mastering the art of maneuvering these beasts will have you feeling like a trucking acrobat!</span></p></li><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:119><strong>Remember:</strong><span> These are just the permit tests.</span><span> Once you pass these,</span><span> there's a whole other level of skill tests waiting to put your knowledge to the practical test.</span><span> But hey,</span><span> baby

Pennsylvania?</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=33:1-33:145><span>The fees can change,</span><span> so it's best to check with your local DMV for the latest info.</span><span> But hey,</span><span> think
