<a href=../../../jersey-shore-totally-fake.html></a>
MTV did a pretty great job at making it seem like the cast of the Jersey Shore led a normal life in Seaside Heights. It was so convincing that many of us questioned how the heck the biggest reality stars on the planet — and the probably biggest scene-causers in the world — could slide along the boardwalk unnoticed. The truth is that they couldn't.

Lil Nas X secured his Grammy 2022 dreams by reinventing Kim Kardashian‘s pearly Balmain suit look. She previously wore a similar outfit to her bachelorette party before her 2014 wedding to now ex-husband Kanye West.
The rapper literally screamed That’s What I Want, and with the click of his fingers (well, kinda) took inspiration from the fashion icon’s one-of-a-kind two-piece and wore a similar look himself at the prestigious awards ceremony.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>21 Savage Claims He's Had His Face Tattoos Removed [Update: False Alarm: Tattoos Still There]</h2><time>Aug 16, 2024</time>

[Update: False Alarm, Tattoos Still There]
It appears 21 Savage pulled a fast one on his fans and actually didn’t get the tattoos removed. The buzzing ATL rapper took to his Snapchat Tuesday night and cleared the rumors of his what-to-believed non-tattoo'd face (see below via his IG fan page).&nbsp;
21 Savage's large knife tattoo on his forehead has already spawned its very own meme (ISSA KNIFE) and has become something of a signature for the rapper, even using the symbol in the artwork for his latest project, Savage Mode.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>47 Friends Facts Every Superfan Should Know - Friends TV Show Trivia</h2><time>Aug 16, 2024</time>

Unfortunately for Blac Chyna (also known as Angela White), healthy relationships haven't come easily in life. Seeing as she grew up with a mother like Tokyo Toni, it's understandable that emotions can be difficult for the former OnlyFans creator to express.
