They are local and we live with this kind of thing everyday and it just becomes sad.”</p><p>“It’s really sad. I mean this is a very really good place and a lot of people come here to get food and stuff,” says Avery Donaldson, another customer.</p><p>Moran says this is not the first time Coya’s Cafe was burglarized. She says the cafe experienced another break-in last year and around a month ago, a car crashed into their building and damaged the front of the store.</p><h2 class=inline-related-stories__heading>4 MORE</h2><ul class=inline-related-stories__list><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="2 juveniles arrested after Prophetstown burglary, shots fired in city limits">2 juveniles arrested after storage unit burglary,&nbsp;…</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Burlington area men arrested for burglary, assault">2 men arrested for burglary, assault</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Sterling man in custody after burglary investigation">Sterling man in custody after burglary investigation</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Rock Island man arrested for burglary, assaulting a police officer">QC man arrested for burglary, assaulting police officer</a></h3></li></ul><p>Moran is upset that her staff has to deal with these issues.</p><p>“Some days were all exhausted. We’re super tired because it’s long days,” says Moran. “Then all of a sudden, somebody comes in and breaks in and takes what’s part of them because it’s their salaries, their earnings.”</p><p>Despite the recent unfortunate events, Moran sees the recent break-in as just a small setback. The community’s support continues to motivate her through the difficulties.</p><p>“I’m hoping the community can come together to support them a little bit – get them back on their feet,” says Donaldson.</p><p>“Anything that we can do to support the police and support the community, I think we should do it,” says Scratchfield.</p><p>“People’s support, love, words. That’s what makes it better,” says Moran. “And then you feel like, OK, it’s worth it. I’m going to keep going. I did fall but I’m going to get up.”</p><p>To find out more about Coya’s, visit <a href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.facebook.com/COYASCAFE rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46cqaKllWS2brDInWSfmZyheqPB02agpmWXpLavs4ytpmaflal6tryMqK6nnaJivKd5wa6poKSRp7a7scNmpKikmaOybq%2FAn5xmq6SWxrR51KmZnpmkZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-to-pay-xfinity-bill-by-phone-html.html><span>←</span><span>How To Pay Xfinity Bill By Phone</span></a>
