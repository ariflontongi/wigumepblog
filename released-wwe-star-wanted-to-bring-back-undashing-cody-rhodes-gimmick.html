Cody’s natural charisma and relatable attitude have helped him win the hearts of many fans.&nbsp;That said, he wasn’t always like this as Rhodes was once a major heel in WWE. Now it appears a recently released WWE star wanted to bring back Rhodes’ ‘Undashing’ gimmick.</p><p>After his match with Rey Mysterio back in 2011, Cody Rhodes started wearing a protective face mask and didn’t want people to see his face. This was preceded by his popular ‘Dashing’ Cody Rhodes gimmick, as he became ‘Undashing.’</p><p>While speaking during a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch stream</a>, released <a href=#>WWE Superstar Mansoor</a> revealed that he wanted to emulate Cody Rhodes’ ‘Undashing’ gimmick, which would have started after Cody Rhodes hit a Cross Rhodes on Mansoor.</p><p>“I wanted him to hit me with the Cross Rhodes & it would break my nose. Then, I could do Undashing. I wanted to wear the mask like him & do the angle where I thought I was the ugliest person in the world & a horribly disfigured mutant. Everyone kept saying, ‘we want Male Models to have more edge, we need more aggressive & viscous. ‘What can we do?’ I kept saying, ‘Break my nose. I’m this viscous goblin’.”</p><p>Obviously, that gimmick will never happen again after Mace and Mansoor’s WWE release yesterday. Regardless, Cody Rhodes’ current gimmick is arguably his best and fans wouldn’t have it any other way.</p><p>What’s your opinion on this interesting Cody Rhodes story?
