She announced that she'd be right there for Willis&nbsp;as "our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities."</p><p>According to <a href=#>The Aphasia Association</a>, the typically progressive condition "is always due to injury to the brain — most commonly from a stroke, particularly in older individuals." Over time, it can prevent the sufferer from being able to summon up names of objects and form sentences. Eventually, it can seriously hamper their reading and&nbsp;verbal communication&nbsp;abilities.</p><p>Moore posted the statement alongside an absolutely adorable throwback photo of an oh-so-young Willis looking devilishly handsome. Moore shared that they were dealing with things as "a strong family unit." The heartbreaking announcement came a week after <a href=#>Moore had posted a loving birthday message to Willis</a>&nbsp;on <a href=#>Instagram</a>, admitting how "thankful" she was to him for their "blended family." Moore often posts photos of their big combined family, including <a href=#>an awesome pic</a> of everybody together celebrating Father's Day. "Your kids are so lucky to have you," Moore captioned the photo, proving their bond as family is built to last.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWlnaIB5e8OepKJlnaS8s7GMoqpmqpWlvLPAxJ2jsmWYmrmxtc2gZJuqpZiybsPIpaOiq12eu260yKxkraGdmnqwsoynnJ6cXZ%2FCtMCMpaCknV2brq%2B%2FjLCmrqSUYrK5vMScq2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./coco-austin-net-worth-136020.html><span>←</span><span>Coco Austin Net Worth</span></a>
