Kiwi UFC star Justin Tafa has closed out the year on a high, finishing American Harry Hunsucker with a first-round head kick in Las Vegas on Sunday.
After a camp that Tafa said had everything go wrong that could have, including seeing him become the first heavyweight to miss weight in UFC history, the 28-year-old shrugged off the struggles to put on the best performance of his UFC career."><meta name=author content="Billy Koelling"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Unsuccessful with his only takedown attempt, Tafa asserted his dominance on the feet - wobbling Hunsucker a couple of times before finishing him off with a head kick.</p><p>Both fighters landed just five strikes each in the fight according to UFC statistics, with Tafa making every one of his count.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"What more can you say?" Tafa said when asked how he felt about his performance.</p><p>"I didn't get tagged once. He was trying to put me in submissions and I was like, 'Bro, get out of here'."</p><p>Despite the impressive performance, Tafa was not eligible to win a US$50,000 performance of the night bonus due to missing weight, while he also forfeits 30 per cent of his purse to Hunsucker.</p><p>He addressed his weight cut after the fight, saying he followed his normal process but he lost no weight at all, before apologising for the miss.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>"I saunaed for like, 11 or 12 hours just to get it and by the time I hit that last pound, I don't think I could have fought if I continued," Tafa said.</p><p>"A goal of mine was to make history, but that wasn't the way I wanted to. It was unprofessional of me and it will never happen again, and I apologise to all those who were involved."</p><p>The win saw Tafa finish the year on the right side of the ledger after two losses earlier in 2021 - one in which he seriously injured his hand.</p><p>He said, if he was injury-free, he would like to make his return in early 2022 as part of the UFC 271 card on February 13, which is being headlined by Israel Adesanya's rematch against Robert Whittaker.</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-sport">Related articles</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmrKifp8FwwcWcZKOto6m2r3nTmp2aZZOhrqq50madoqqjqXqzu9Snm2ajnqSwrLvUrWSwoZ5ivLex0Wafmqqirnqpwc2srJyjlad8jJqxiWmPh4dpkoKmtYZ4fW6GaZSSkpWEfm1n</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./351127-travis-scott-and-andr-3000-shared-harrowing-tales-of-their-hometowns-on-the-ends-new-song.html><span>←</span><span>Travis Scott &amp;amp; Andr 3000 Shared Harrowing Tales Of Their Hometowns On &amp;quot;The Ends&amp;quot;</span></a>
