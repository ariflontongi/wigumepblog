She is believed to be thirty-seven years old, having had Melly at a young age.</p><p>She reportedly previously worked as a nurse and a music manager. It isn’t clear if Jamie has taken up a new profession currently.</p><p>However, going by her Instagram bio, Jamie appears to be managing BSlime and J Flexx at the moment.</p><p>While Melly remains locked up in Florida, his mother took to Instagram to wish him love on turning twenty-four on May 1. She captioned it: “Happy Birthday. It’s Melly Day Big&nbsp;#24‼️&nbsp;I love you so much I wish I could hear your voice today, but I know this is almost over.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=ynw-mellys-mom-has-been-rallying-to-free-him>YNW Melly’s mom has been rallying to free him</h2><p>In addition to the hashtag #freemelly added to almost each and every post she has shared on Instagram, Jamie constantly keeps her followers updated about her son’s condition in prison by sharing the letters he’s sent her from jail or by posting updates about his trial.</p><p>On February 14, 2023, which marks four years since Melly was taken into custody, his mother shared a carousel on Instagram with a heart-wrenching caption that read:</p><p>“4 years since I hugged you and you told me don’t worry. Now all I do is worry about you but it’s almost over you will be home soon God got us. I love you.”</p><p>She often posts pictures with her friends and family members from various events and functions, but always keeps Melly in her thoughts.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=update-on-the-rappers-murder-trial>Update on the rapper’s murder trial</h2><p>Melly’s trial is expected to begin in the third week of June once the jury selection is completed.</p><p>If convicted, based on the decision of the jury abiding by Florida’s altered law which has considerably reduced the threshold for the death penalty, the rapper could face capital punishment.</p><p>Unlike previously when all the jurors had to reach a unanimous decision, the new law allows the motion for the death penalty to pass even if four out of twelve votes against it.</p><p>Melly, who is locked up in the Broward Country Jail after being <a href=#>arrested</a> in 2019, has pleaded not guilty. But, his bond was denied.</p><h3 class=tags-title>Related Topics</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbXTnGWcp51ksq95xptma2hiaHxxgo5pbmixnqx6rrHLpbCsZZ2kum62wKagnmWUmrqwutJmoqKml2K%2ForjLopysZaSkeqe%2BxJ5koaGdYryvecinqq2Zl6eurnnAoZyanF2ks27A0aKYpWc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-kirk-herbstreit-espn.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Kirk Herbstreit? | The US Sun</span></a>
