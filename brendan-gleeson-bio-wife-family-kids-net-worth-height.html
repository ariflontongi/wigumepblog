venturing into the acting world.&nbsp;He got his big break after taking a place as one of the most recognizable characters in the Harry Potter series as Alastor Moody.&nbsp;Since then he has become one of the most recognizable faces in the world and has starred in other projects such as&nbsp;</span><span>In Bruges, Edge of Tomorrow, Paddington 2.</span><span>&nbsp;He is a Golden Globe nominee and an Emmy winner.&nbsp;Find out more about Brendan Gleeson by reading below.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Brendan Gleeson’s bio</span></strong></h2><p><span>Sometimes the biggest obstacle in our journey to success is us.&nbsp;Brendan Gleeson worked as a teacher for ten years before deciding to pursue his dream of becoming an actor.&nbsp;Today, hesitation has only cost him ten more years that he could have had as a professional actor.</span></p><p><span>His long road to success began from secondary school, a few years after his birth on March 29, 1955 in Dublin, Ireland.&nbsp;He was born to parents Frank Gleeson and Pat Gleeson.&nbsp;Brendan Gleeson later fell in love with acting, a profession that required reading many screenplays.&nbsp;So it was good that he fell so much in love with reading at a young age that he is described as an avid reader to himself and to those who knew him at the time.&nbsp;For his education he was tutored at St. Joseph’s CBS in Dublin.&nbsp;It was at St. Joseph’s that he fell in love with acting after serving in the school’s drama group.</span></p><p><span>Despite his great passion for acting, Brendan tried to play it safe and became a teacher after completing his acting training and teaching secondary school students at Catholic Belcamp College in North County Dublin.&nbsp;He taught Irish and English.&nbsp;Luckily, our future actor Alastor Moody felt good about not giving up his dream entirely and worked on various stage productions for the theater company Passion Machine.</span></p><p><span>During this time he appeared in notable plays such as Brownbread, Home and Wasters.&nbsp;As a later director at Passion Machine, he provided a glimpse into its history by writing a number of plays for Passion Machine, including Breaking Up and The Birdtable.</span></p><span>After 10 years of combining the acting few responsibilities that came with his responsibilities as a school teacher, he retired from teaching and became a full-time actor in 1991.&nbsp;His first onscreen project was in a TV movie in 1989.&nbsp;</span><span>Dear Sarah</span><span>&nbsp;as Brendan Dowd.&nbsp;The following year he made his big screen debut in&nbsp;</span><span>Das Feld</span><span>&nbsp;, where he played the character&nbsp;</span><span>Steinhauer</span><span>&nbsp;.</span><p><span>Since debuting in both media, Brendan has gone on to act in multiple films and TV shows, racking up credits and establishing himself as a great actor, both in his Irish/English film industry and in Hollywood.&nbsp;In film, he has appeared in a total of 77 films including three of the films in the Harry Potter series;&nbsp;</span><span>Gangs of New York, Troy, Bruges, Heart of the Sea</span><span>&nbsp;among others.&nbsp;He acted on television&nbsp;</span><span>In den Sturm, den contract, that’s my father,</span><span>&nbsp;among other things, with a total of 14 credits, which are mostly television films.&nbsp;He has quite a few awards and nominations to his name such as an Emmy award, two BIFA awards, three Golden Globe nominations and two BAFTA nominations.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Whatever they pay teachers, it sure can’t be compared to an actor’s financial earnings, especially when he’s as successful as Brendan.&nbsp;He has been able to earn a net worth of $4 million through his appearances in multiple films spanning over 80 films and TV shows.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Family – wife and children</span></strong></h2><p><span>Brendan Gleeson, despite his fame and fortune, has quite simply nurtured life.&nbsp;He has been married to one woman, Mary Weldon, since 1982.&nbsp;The marriage produced four children, two of whom followed in their father’s footsteps and were actors – Domhnall and Brian Gleeson.&nbsp;Domhnall has featured in several films such as&nbsp;</span><span>Ex Machina, The Revenant and About Time</span><span>&nbsp;.&nbsp;His other children are – Fergus Gleeson and Rory Gleeson.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height</span></strong></h2><p><span>Brendan’s height, which is not a typical Hollywood performer’s physique, was one of his tools to play famous roles in movies.&nbsp;He stands at a height of 6 feet 2 inches with a body weight of 90 kg.&nbsp;He is a man with blond hair and blue eyes.</span></p><h3 class=main-box-title>You may also like</h3><p class=postsid
