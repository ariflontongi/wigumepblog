Verse 1
Master, the tempest is raging.
The billows are tossing high.
The sky is o'er shadowed with blackness,
No shelter or help is nigh.
Carest Thou not that we perish?
How canst Thou lie asleep,
When each moment so madly is threatning,
A grave in the angry deep?Chorus
The winds and the waves
Shall obey my will, peace be still.
Whether the wrath of the storm-tossed sea
Or demons, or men, or whatever it be.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Teen Mom: Are Leah and Corey still married? Catch up with the Netflix couple now! Tue 22 Decemb</h2><time>Aug 24, 2024</time>
