Unfortunately, this approach only works on someone like Lil Uzi Vert. Cordae found himself fielding a request from a fan at a recent concert who held a sign that said, "Pay my college tuition." Cordae stopped the show for a moment to acknowledge the sign and hit the fan with a big fat no.

If you looked outside your window and saw a 10-foot-tall, Tyrannosaurus-looking mofo with gray skin and sharp teeth, what would you do? Well, back in 2004, a handful of people in Papua New Guinea reported having this exact problem. The creature allegedly devoured three dogs, which is about as mean as it gets. One witness, Christine Samei, described the dinosaur as a "very huge and ugly looking animal."&nbsp;So, understandably enough, according to&nbsp;Australian newspaper The Age,&nbsp;the villagers had&nbsp;phoned up the cops.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Does Rooms to Go have a price guarantee?</h2><time>Aug 31, 2024</time>

It has impressed Hollywood to the point where normally adversarial studio heads are gushing over the film’s astounding run as if it were their own.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Is it expensive to move to Hawaii?</h2><time>Aug 31, 2024</time>
