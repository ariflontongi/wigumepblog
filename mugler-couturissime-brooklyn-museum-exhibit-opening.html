Some sported vintage, like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a41980642/kylie-jenner-two-looks-mugler-couturissime-exhibition-opening/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kylie Jenner" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60"><u>Kylie Jenner</u></a>, who wore three looks pulled straight from the archives, including a spring 1997 couture webbed bodysuit and satin cocoon coat that were taken off display temporarily for her to wear as she walked through the exhibit. Others, like Lourdes Leon, Julia Fox, and much of the New York City nightlife scene invited, wore the new Mugler illusions catsuits, cut-out twist bodysuits, and deconstructed blazers from the 2022 spring collection.</p><img alt="kylie jenner mugler brooklyn museum" title="kylie jenner mugler brooklyn museum" width=2571 height=3600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bfa-37380-5190914-1668713696.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">BFA</span><p>Kylie Jenner with Mugler creative director&nbsp;Casey Cadwallader at the opening party for the&nbsp;Thierry Mugler Couturissime exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum.

To sort of charge it sensually, by putting clothes on it to add power and drama to someone's silhouette,” he said. “There's the craft of the clothing and the fit of the clothing and what that's saying, and then there's the culture and the community that Mugler lives within. It's people who aren't afraid to wear something daring, people who would like to celebrate themselves and to sort of feel that charge.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Those people were there on Wednesday, many of them wearing Cadwallader’s Mugler while admiring Thierry’s Mugler; the culture taking in the craft.</p><img alt="a photo from the photoshoot for the lingerie revisited catalogue starring carla bruni and photographed by helmut newton" title="a photo from the photoshoot for the lingerie revisited catalogue starring carla bruni and photographed by helmut newton" width=1338 height=2000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fig-203-j53-1668709626.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Mugler</span><p>A photo from the Lingerie Revisited catalogue, starring Carla Bruni and photographed by Helmut Newton.

Invitees gasped at designer Marc Jacobs taking in the details of the 1999 Les Méduse asymmetrical organza dress while simultaneously warning a guest not to step on the five-foot train of their sheer bustier gown. It was hard to even see the surrounding Helmut Newton photos of Carla Bruni wearing the fall 1998 “Lingerie Revisited” collection, not because so many people were gawking at the sight of Jacobs in person but because most of them were wearing platforms that made them even taller than the mannequins.<br></p><img alt="marc jacobs laverne cox and charly defrancesco" title="marc jacobs laverne cox and charly defrancesco" width=2571 height=3600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bfa-37384-5190651-1668714916.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">BFA</span><p>Marc Jacobs, Laverne Cox, and Charly Defrancesco.</p><img alt="a guest walking through the mugler exhibit, wearing a gown with a long train" title="a guest walking through the mugler exhibit, wearing a gown with a long train" width=2571 height=3600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bfa-37384-5190676-1-1668714991.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">BFA</span><p>A guest walking through the Mugler exhibit, wearing a gown with a long train.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot wanted the exhibition to feel like a performance long after the opening festivities have ended. “I built it like an opera with different acts, like a fashion opera about the passions and obsessions of Mugler through the years,” he told me in an interview before the event.</p><img alt="mugler brooklyn museum exhibit" title="Thierry Mugler: Couturissime Preview &amp;amp; Exhibition Opening at the Brooklyn Museum" width=5875 height=3917 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bfa-37384-5189425-1668710562.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Mike Vitelli/BFA.com</span><p>Archival pieces from the ’90s on display in a gallery dedicated to Helmut Newton’s photography of Mugler.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Mugler opera in Brooklyn begins with a simple white wall displaying a quote from the designer in large black text: “In my work I’ve always tried to make people look stronger than they really are.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The climax of the exhibit is certainly the “fembot couture'' segment, which houses the famous Maschienmensch from the 20th anniversary show in 1995—a robotic armor suit that paid tribute to the character Futura from the 1925 novel Metropolis (later made famous in a 1927 film). Often regarded as Mugler’s masterpiece, it’s housed in a gallery made of mirrors, glass boxes, and tiny sparkling lights, immersing guests into a setting reminiscent of the novel's dystopia.</p><img alt="mugler brooklyn museum exhibit" title="mugler brooklyn museum exhibit" width=5616 height=3744 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dig-e-2022-thierry-mugler-02-ps21-1668710595.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Mugler</span><p>The Fembot Couture gallery of the exhibit, featuring the famous Maschienmensch robotic armor suit from the 20th anniversary show in 1995.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The finale, though, is Cadwallader’s personal favorite: the Metamorphosis section with underwater projections and a soundtrack of bubbling echos, starring silhouettes from the “Les Insectes,” and “La Chimère” collections of 1997 and 1998. There are nymphs with glass-and-shell bustiers, organza jellyfish, and a gown covered in iridescent scales, embroidered with crystals, costume diamonds, feathers, and horsehair. Jenner’s borrowed look would have been there if she weren't partying in it not far away.</p><img alt="kylie jenner" title="Thierry Mugler: Couturissime Preview &amp;amp; Exhibition Opening at the Brooklyn Museum" width=3525 height=5287 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bfa-37384-5189784-1668710648.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Mike Vitelli/BFA.com</span><p>Kylie Jenner wearing an archival coat and catsuit borrowed from the exhibit, standing in place of the mannequin that wears it.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"Fashion is more standard now, less exploratory, and extravagant. But this is about a period in fashion that does not exist anymore."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But what really makes the exhibit feel like an opera is that it requires sustained attention. While Loriot hopes the exhibit will attract young people, he didn’t want to display things on the sort of timeline they’re used to scrolling through. “It is not shown chronologically on purpose,” he told me. “You must read the label to know what decade it is from. It was not about trends back then; it was about standing out and being creative. It is important for a young generation to understand what real creativity is. Fashion is more standard now, less exploratory, and extravagant. But this is about a period in fashion that does not exist anymore.” The exhibit doesn't connect the dots for you like a five-part video series on TikTok would.</p><img alt="a ﻿guest pole dancing at the ﻿thierry mugler couturissime party held two floors down from the exhibit at the ﻿brooklyn museum" title="a ﻿guest pole dancing at the ﻿thierry mugler couturissime party held two floors down from the exhibit at the ﻿brooklyn museum" width=3600 height=2402 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bfa-37377-5189760-1668714573.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">BFA</span><p>A guest pole dancing at the party, held two floors down from the exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Cadwallader knows he is currently designing for an entirely different time. “Making clothing then was different. Culture was different.” But he insists there are similarities between what he’s doing now and the legacy Mugler created: “Mr. Mugler and I both really love people. And we love different kinds of people. And we don't just want to do what the rest of the establishment is doing.” That’s exactly how you end up with a museum exhibition attended by people who are just as interested in pole-dancing in a recent ready-to-wear Mugler catsuit as they are analyzing lengthy gallery descriptions about how Mr. Mugler created his signature trompe l’oeil reptile skin.</p><img alt="anaa saber, alexander roth" title="Thierry Mugler: Couturissime Preview &amp;amp; Exhibition Opening at the Brooklyn Museum" width=2880 height=3600 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bfa-37377-5189765-1668717262.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Sansho Scott/BFA.com</span><p>Guests Anaa Saber, and Alexander Roth.
