Scroll down to read his five top tips.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>1. CREATE A HARMONIOUS BATHROOM</strong>"The surefire way to maintain domestic harmony is two bathrooms per couple," said Georgis. "Short of that, I highly recommend bath tray caddies with a book rest for in tub reading, radiant heated floors, heated towel racks, electrical outlets in a vanity drawer for hairdryers, and maximum storage. Of course, stone slab floors and walls are essential."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>2. MAXIMIZE YOUR KITCHEN COUNTER SPACE</strong>"A fabulous kitchen is one where you can socialize with friends while cooking—unless you have a cook," he said. "The more counter space the better (copper counters are amazingly warm), and built-in drawer dividers eliminate frantic searches for whisks and preserve sanity."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>3. UPHOLSTER YOUR BEDROOM WALLS</strong>"For master bedrooms, upholstered walls provide acoustic refuge and warmth," advised Georgis. "Large bedside tables with drawers and shelves are a must. Some clients request locks on bedside table drawers and large mirrors on walls parallel to the bed."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>4. LET YOUR CHILDREN DECORATE YOUR PLAYROOM WALLS</strong>"Draw-on wallpaper decriminalizes your child's love of graffiti and acoustical insulation is <i>de rigueur,</i>" he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>5. THE ULTIMATE THING YOU NEED FOR YOUR HOUSE</strong>"Dimmers, dimmers, and more dimmers," urged Georgis. "On <i>all</i> lighting!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, take a look inside the book, <i>Make It Fabulous: The Architecture and Designs of William T.
