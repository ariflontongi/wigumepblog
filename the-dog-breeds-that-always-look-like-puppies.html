"Most important, it would never lose its puppy face." At the time, breeders were hoping the so-called "cava-poo-chon" would fit the bill, which would cost $3,500 to pay. The dog weighed between 10 and 15 pounds and had the sweetest little baby face. However, the American Kennel Club pooh-poohed the cava-poo-chon, refusing to recognize the tiny hybrid as a legitimate <a href=#>breed</a>. Nonetheless, it represented an expensive fixation on finding "the dog-face fountain of youth and perfect pet accessory."</p><p>But why do humans go gaga for pooches with puppy dog eyes and matching puppy dog everything else? Perhaps the answer lies in natural selection. Citing a 2019 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, <a href=#>Vice writes</a>&nbsp;that behavioral evidence indicates that domesticated canines evolved to resemble babies. Why? Humans tend to be more attentive and nurturing toward baby-faced canines. When they raise their eyebrows their eyes look larger and hence more infantile. Cocking their brows make them seem sad, arousing sympathy. Combine that with a well-timed <a href=#>head tilt</a>, and owners are putty in their paws.</p><p>In other words, adorable doggies are custom-made to manipulate us. <a href=#>Rewarding their cuteness</a> with belly rubs and treats just trains them to manipulate us more. One might even say that by breeding them to look puppy-like, we're basically begging dogs to exploit our emotional weaknesses. So breeds that already look infantile have a natural advantage. Here are some of the cutest manipulators in the canine world.</p><h2>You've the cutest little baby face</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.grunge.com/img/gallery/the-dog-breeds-that-always-look-like-puppies/youve-the-cutest-little-baby-face-1579017906.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Shutterstock</span><p>Determining what <a href=#>counts as a breed</a>&nbsp;is arguably arbitrary to to an extent. So we'll take our cues from Pet Central contributor Elizabeth Xu, who <a href=#>compiled a list</a>&nbsp;of six breeds and consulted American Kennel Club vice president Gina DiNardo. Among them are the Maltese, which looks like a walking cotton ball and the Yorkshire Terrier, which looks like it has more fur than actual dog. The adorable Pomeranian looks like a little bundle of joy, what with its tiny face and tiny everything else. But the breed's thick coat looks like a bundle of joylessness to groom. The remainder of the list includes the fancy-looking and even fancier-sounding Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, the Toy Fox Terrier, and everyone's favorite purse accessory, the Chihuahua.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9l2xqcGtfqbWmecOonmaaopqypb%2BMrZ%2BarF2Wubit2KxkpaefoHqttcqeZKmtoKW2pr%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./neutrogena-rapid-wrinkle-repair-retinol-face-serum-sale-amazon.html><span>←</span><span>The 15 Best Over-the-Counter Retinol Formulas of 2024, Tested and Reviewed</span></a>
