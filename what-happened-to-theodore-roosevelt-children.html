Just 7 when his father became president, Archie spent most of his childhood in the White House, though he was known to be much quieter than his siblings. Like his brothers, he attended Harvard, from which he graduated in 1917, the same year he married Grace Lockwood. After graduation, Archie worked at a carpet company until World War I, where he served with distinction as an officer and was noted for his bravery and keeping his cool under fire. He received numerous citations for his courage, including France's Croix de guerre, but he was given a full disability discharge after suffering major damage to his leg from an artillery bombardment.</p><p dir=ltr>After the war, Archie worked with Sinclair Consolidated Oil Company but distanced himself after the Teapot Dome scandal, moving instead into the finance industry. When World War II began, Archie asked his cousin, President Franklin Roosevelt, to appoint him to an officer position and was made a lieutenant colonel. He once again served with distinction before receiving a full disability discharge, making him the only American soldier to be medically discharged for the same injury in two wars. Following World War II, Archie supported numerous conservative organizations, especially the John Birch Society. He died in 1979 at the age of 85 and is buried with much of the rest of his family in Oyster Bay.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9k2pvcGtnZMSprdNmn5qooJq7prCMraZmrJiavKW70Z5kq6efqLK3scutZJygmaGxs7HNaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dateline-secrets-uncovered-what-happened-matt-podolak.html><span>←</span><span>What happened to Matt Podolak?</span></a>
