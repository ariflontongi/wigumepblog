<a href=../../are-cocktail-onions-and-pickled-onions-the-same-html.html></a>
Answer
In most cases, a cocktail onion is a pearl onion that has been pickled in brine with modest quantities of turmeric and paprika. Pearl onions have a naturally sweet flavour, which makes them a fantastic match for a variety of drinks. Sweet onions that are yellow or red in colour, on the other hand, may be utilised.
