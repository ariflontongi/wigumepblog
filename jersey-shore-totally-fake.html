A security tent was erected next the home and police monitored the property at all times. Barricades were set up to keep fans away, but they only served as a resting place for paparazzi hoping to catch a glimpse. Eventually, producers stopped allowing the cast to go out on the balcony altogether.</p><p>"Every time we went outside, the whole block would scream," Ortiz-Magro admitted in a <a href=#>Vulture</a> interview. "It was like being at a Yankee game when they chant everybody's name."</p><p>Things weren't much better at the Shore Store, where thousands of people lined up hoping to get inside and meet the cast. Salsano only let them in if they pretended to be real customers and didn't talk about the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlobIZ1e8meqaydqWLAqbvRnmStp6SWua3FjJ%2BYpJ1f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-the-richest-person-in-dubai.html><span>←</span><span>Who is the richest person in Dubai?</span></a>
