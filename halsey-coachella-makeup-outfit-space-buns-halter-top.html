The final look, which they wore to the Revolve Festival, included earrings, hair barrettes, face jewels, white sunglasses, and matching Converse sneakers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Halsey joined other celebrities, like Vanessa Hudgens, Hailey and Justin Bieber, and Kendall Jenner, at the weekend's festivities, which took place in Indio, Calif. Headliners for the event included Harry Styles, Billie Eilish, and Swedish House Mafia x The Weeknd, as well as Megan Thee Stallion and Doja Cat.
