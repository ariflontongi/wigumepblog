Carrie Bradshaw's fashion proclivities are well-documented. There's the Big Flower Energy that dominated the show's final season (and repeats in the follow-up films and And Just Like That... revival).

And Manolo Blahnik is so central to the plot that he's basically the fifth lead.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Clarins' New Lightweight Serum Gives Skin a Plump Glow</h2><time>Aug 17, 2024</time>
