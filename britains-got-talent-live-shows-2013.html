The chemistry between judges <a class=hm-link href=#>Simon Cowell</a>, <a class=hm-link href=#>Amanda Holden</a>,<strong> David Walliams</strong> and <strong>Alesha Dixon</strong>&nbsp;has been&nbsp;electric as ever on the show whose weird and wonderful acts that never cease to amaze. With the semi finals fast approaching, the judges look back at this year's series and look forward to the competition heating up as the live shows begin on 27 May.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2f16f436389e-bgt-judges-cheering-a.jpg><p id=ec8otPTNl96S data-wc=304>Pop stars <strong>Olly Murs</strong>, <strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong>, <strong>Ellie Goulding</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Demi Lovato</strong> are among the special guests confirmed to perform on the live shows, giving the stars of the future plenty of inspiration. The judges reveal why comedian <strong>Jack Carroll</strong> and Hungarian shadow dance group <strong>Attraction</strong> are tipped for the top, all about their disagreements and advice for BGT hopefuls. <strong>Simon Cowell</strong><strong>Was it difficult deliberating who to put through to the live shows? Were there many arguments? </strong>It was pretty difficult deliberating who to put through but there are always arguments and I think that's a healthy thing. There were a few acts I genuinely didn't think should go through but I got out voted. So these semis are going to be very interesting! <strong>Are you excited about being reunited with your BGT family? What are you most excited about? </strong>I am excited about being reunited with the judges, I really like this panel. They are great fun to work with, David is erratic and you just never know how he is going to behave. It's like having a horrible naughty school boy working with you but that is part of the fun…<strong>What have been the weirdest or worst acts this series?</strong> There have been some really, really weird acts this year. Unfortunately the worst acts have been the animal acts. I thought after Pudsey we'd get some brilliant animals but it has been a complete disaster. So next year I hope this will change. <strong>Amanda Holden</strong><strong>What have been your BGT highlights this year?</strong> Being completely united with Alesha against the boys. We never stop laughing - it's been a brilliant series. In terms of the acts, I love the amount of comedy we've had this year. Jack Carroll was one of the standouts of course but also the impressionists – I love Philip Green.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ef50ecab7357-jack-carroll-bgt-a.jpg><p id=e3BlfjQhZ4IW data-wc=213><strong>What response have you had from people to this year's show? Which contestants seem to be the favourites? </strong>There has been a massive response. People have been stopping me in the street. Everyone's watching and talking about it. It's been amazing. The act that has gone across the board, from the children in Lexi's school to grown-ups was the shadow act Attraction. It really touched people on lots of different levels, from the emotion of the piece to the pure cleverness. <strong>What are you looking forward to most at the live shows? </strong>The adrenaline, the buzz, the glamour, the frocks! And of course the acts - the best from the auditions all coming on and giving their all. The excitement backstage and from the audience, the emotion. It's indescribable! <strong>What advice have you got for the acts through to the live shows? </strong>Just go out and do it! Wear what you want. Sing what you want. This is your chance so don't hold back! <strong>Alesha Dixon</strong><strong>What response have you had from people to this year's show? Which contestants seem to be the favourites? </strong>I've had really positive feedback! People are loving Attraction! They are one of my favourite acts too but I still think it's a bit early to predict who could win.</p><p id=eTdUWLSAGaFT><strong></strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/837dff69e68b-bgt-judges-attraction-a.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p id=eMecGYLTu7RF data-wc=179><strong>Was it difficult deliberating who to put through to the live shows? Were there many arguments?</strong> There were so many arguments! I was genuinely getting annoyed with some of the acts being put through and really fighting for the acts I believe in. It's always a tense moment but we all have different tastes so it's inevitable. <strong>What are you looking forward to most at the live shows?</strong> Seeing how the acts rise to the occasion. I will be so nervous for them but really excited. It's a life changing moment and they have one chance to really shine. <strong>Which acts have you been most impressed with?</strong> Jack Carroll, Francine Lewis and Attraction have been the stand outs for me. They have something special I really hope they smash it in the semis. <strong>What advice have you got for the acts through to the live shows? </strong>Work hard. They need to up their game and bring it! Embrace the nerves and go for it! They have nothing to lose and everything to gain. <strong>Click here for more news from </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Britain's Got Talent</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
