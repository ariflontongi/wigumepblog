The reality star appeared in a fun makeover video on Kandee's YouTube channel in which she was transformed into Aladdin's love interest – complete with hair band, earrings and matching eyebrows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/47655c16901b-kim-kardashian-princess-jasmine-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eSzxAPMap9Na data-wc=7><strong>Kim looks uncannily like the Disney princess</strong></p><p id=efwtQMNHMZok data-wc=61>Kim – who it has to be said, already bears more than a passing resemblance to the Disney character – looks uncannily like Jasmine in the final result. However, there was one person who definitely wasn't convinced by the transformation – her daughter North. In the video, once Kim's makeover is complete, she says to Kandee: "I'm going to call North".</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian Princess Jasmine (Aladdin) Transformation | Kandee Johnson</a><p id=eK_z99zcOC1I data-wc=63>The 37-year-old then speaks over FaceTime to her daughter, saying "Hey North, it's Princess Jasmine… I have your mummy's phone. She wanted me to call you and tell you she's on my magic carpet."&nbsp;The four-year-old remained unfazed, replying "No you're not, you’re really Kim!"&nbsp;and later on remarking "You don't sound like Jasmine". Kim laughed, explaining that North was her "biggest critic".</p><p id=e8edk6iyTI93><a class=hm-link href=#>READ MORE: The KKW x Mario makeup collection is here and we want everything</a></p><p id=eYjG1dVQqQXy data-wc=43>In the video, Kandee creates the look by applying a one-colour foundation base to Kim’s skin. She then, bizarrely, applies water-soluble glue stick to flatten Kim’s eyebrows before disguising them with concealer. She then paints on Jasmine-style eyebrows above Kim’s natural brow line.</p><p id=eK3tPXin4OhD><a class=hm-link href=#>READ MORE: Kim Kardashian responds to copyright claims about controversial nude fragrance bottle</a></p><p id=eiV-vMeyQ-N- data-wc=70>During the makeover the pair discuss childhood memories and beauty mistakes, with Kim revealing that Jasmine was always her favourite Disney character and that she went through the dreaded over-plucked eyebrow phase in the 1990s. Kandee and Kim are likely to have met through their work on TV&nbsp;series , an -style show for makeup artists, on which Kandee is a judge and Kim is an executive producer.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaKSao5WqvXB%2Bj2pvaW1iboF5hZZpZqShnWK4or7DmqqhoZGjerG%2ByKeanqujYreiv8yipZ5lnZa4prvVnqlo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jesse-chavez-net-worth-2024.html><span>←</span><span>Jesse Chavez Net Worth 2024</span></a>
