I came up hearing about BMF when I was younger and just seeing how big their movement was. Being a part of this story on Starz with 50 Cent, man, it just feels amazing. It’s something I can’t explain. I’m just grateful for that opportunity,” she told HipHopDX.</p><span><h2 id=h-kash-doll-at-bmf-premiere>Kash Doll At "BMF" Premiere</h2></span><p>ATLANTA, GA - SEPTEMBER 23: Kash Doll attends STARZ Series "BMF" World Premiere at Cellairis Amphitheatre at Lakewood on September 23, 2021 in Atlanta, Georgia.(Photo by Prince Williams/FilmMagic)</p><p>From there, Kash Doll explained that her focus has completely changed since becoming a mother. She gave birth to her first son in January 2022. “Whatever I’m doing, I just give it all I got because my time means something. I could be with my baby,” she said. “So while I’m here, I’m a make it worth it, you know what I’m saying? I just got a different motivation now. I just try to give my best and that’s all I can do." She added: “Since I had my son, I’m a little more cautious now. Before I make music or appear in the role, I just think about when he turns 18, and people tell him who his mom is when he finally listens to my music. I just think of my legacy now because my son is my legacy. I just want him to feel proud about what his mama was doing, I would love that for him.”</p><p>Later in the interview, Kash Doll discussed her most recent project, <a href=# rel>Back On Dexter: A Gangsta Grillz Mixtape.</a> The mixtape features Icewear Vezzo, Peezy, Payroll Giovanni, Sada Baby, YN Jay, Baby Money, and more. The 11-song effort arrived, earlier this month, ahead of her highly-anticipated sophomore album.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaIR0hZhmopqrmGKxsLjLZqmenpyasLW%2FjKilZquklr%2Bztc2gZKKmXZe6p3nIrWSjraOpeqexxKWqZpmdlsequsY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-lopezs-father-confirms-shes-having-twins.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Lopez's father confirms: She's having twins</span></a>
