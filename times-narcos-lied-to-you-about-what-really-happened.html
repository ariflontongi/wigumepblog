Borrowing a tie, he goes to spend his first day as a representative, only to be denounced as a narco. Humiliated and enraged, Escobar symbolically removes his tie, storms out the building, and returns to his life of <a href=#>crime</a>. It's a powerful moment, and it more or less really happened — the "more" part being that Escobar really did get elected to the Senate and really did get denounced, the "less" part being that his political career didn't last a single day. According to <a href=#>Biography</a>, Escobar sat in the Senate for two whole years before being ejected.</p><p><a href=#>The New Yorker</a> has additional details. Elected in 1982, Escobar was allowed into the Liberal Party thanks to a corrupt senator named Alberto Santofimio. Once he took his seat, Escobar divided his time between splurging cash in Medellin and trying to get a treaty allowing the extradition of drug traffickers to the United States scrapped. Not that his fellow Congressmen were under any illusions: The justice minister, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, publicly denounced him as a gangster.</p><p>But while in Narcos, the accusation is enough to make Escobar leave, in real life, he tried to turn the tables by accusing Bonilla of being a client of (irony alert) Colombia's cartels. It was only when a newspaper resurfaced his conviction for cocaine possession that Escobar finally got the Congressional boot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9k2xvcW9fqbausdJmpZqqk6TAbrjInptmrJ9ixrDBjJqZqK2kYsSprdNmqZ6ZnKHGbrTAqaeeppWZfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mother-denim-jeans-review-6889292.html><span>←</span><span>This Celebrity-Loved Denim Brand Is Worth the Splurge</span></a>
