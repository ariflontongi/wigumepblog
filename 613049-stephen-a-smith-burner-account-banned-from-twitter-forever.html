Burner Gone For Good</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Now, according to the owner of the account, the burner has been suspended on a permanent basis. However, it seems like this ban was for parodying a prominent person. Considering the main account has "parody" in the title, this ban goes against the new rules of Twitter. Nonetheless, the Stephen A. memes are no longer, and the account owner is clearly upset about it.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In a Twitter thread, the burner owner reached out to Twitter support and lambasted them for not responding to numerous appeals. Overall, it seems like Twitter just doesn't care.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Y’all could at least respond to the appeal," they wrote. "An account with parody in the bio shouldn’t get banned for breaking parody rules because I didn’t change the name of the account after running it for 3 years without any impersonation report. Grandfather me in damnit."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Overall, it is a sad situation when you consider how the Stephen A. burner account was a staple of the NBA Twitter experience. Now, however, Elon Musk has taken away yet another good thing from us.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Hopefully, Twitter sees the error of its ways and reinstates the account, immediately.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
